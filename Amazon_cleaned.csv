Wire Quality is Good.,Very good quality but the wire is 15 meters only at least should be 20 meters for the price......,I am using this with an FD A140x as my satellite speakers wires were getting very flimsy. Out of the box these cables are very thick compared to the ones my speakers had before.After replacing the cables with these ones I noticed two things right away1. My speakers are louder2. The sound quality is much betterOne thing you wanna be careful is that these cables stick out like a sore thumb in front of white walls, so if you are like me who cares about the looks, you might wanna cover these with cable raceways or even paint them like I am planning to do.,Wire is very best quality but cost not worth for it,Durability n quality is absolutely good.,The product is 16 gauge pure copper multi thread wires. Sound quality is impressive.Bears a Black band for veve distinction,Ive seen many reviews where people complain that this cable is not Copper, its Aluminium and even some saying its fake. So I thought Ill clear some doubts about this product.ITS TRUE! This is not a pure Copper cable, its Copper clad Aluminium. Infact most of the speaker cables are Copper clad Aluminium. Majority of the audio signal travel through the outer edge of the conductor skin effect, hence the Copper cladding. Thicker the cladding, better the audio quality, this cable only got a thin cladding of Copper The SteelAluminium reinforced center is for a more durable conductor. Now no where in the description Amazon has mentioned that this is a pure Copper cladding cable, so just need to get your expectations right. You simply cannot expect Oxygen free pure Copper cable at this price Rs 400. You will not find a decent 16 gauge Copper speaker cable for less than Rs 2000.This is a cheap 16 gauge speaker and it does the job very well. This cable is more than enough to deliver good sound to your speakers. Cable quality is average but you get what you pay for. Now if got some high end speakers, then I wont recommend this cable.,Good",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41vJcrdr5mL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Turns out the cap was actually a pretty nice container to blend small amounts of anything. The container itself seems of great quality, has measurements on the side, and also comes with a lid so that nothing splatters outside when youre using the blender.2 There is also a holder with some nails if you wanna mount the blender on a wall.3 The blender itself is amazing to hold, looks great, and is pretty easy to use.4 The blender can even stand on its own if you have to leave it and attend to something else. If you place it vertically, you can leave it as it is.Cons1 After over 15 seconds of continuous blending that is, if Im not just pulsing it but continuously blending, there is this smell of some sort that starts to come from the blender. Im not sure if thats a sign of overheating, or if its normal.2 Theres this groove right above the blade, and every time Im done washing, theres always a little residue that was hiding in that groove which always comes out a few seconds after Im done washing, and I always have to go back to clean that.

Some people asked whether this can be used in a cafe. The answer is simple NO. Reason is that this isnt a sophisticated machine like a professional commercial grade coffee brewer.Now my experience with this machine was good. And a bad thing was that I did not get the steam pipe sleeve. Except that, everything was well packed. When you buy this machine, make sure to rinse the internal passage. throw the first water from the machine. thoroughly wash the caraffe, puck, filter and measurement spoon. Remember to NEVER USE dishwash gel or soaps to wash carafe, puck or anything such. It may ruin the coffee aroma.Method efficient as per my opinion1. Fill the water in tank. No need to measure it as it can be controlled with the selector. Dont run it dry. It may damage the heating element or pump.2. Switch ON the machine. After that, pour the ground coffee powder inside the filter, level it and press it to compress. I use 12 ratio. 1 spoon of coffee powder to 2 spoon of water at output.3. Before changing over to drip mode, open the steam valve and check if sufficient pressure is built. Placing carafe under the puck, slowly move the selector till Europa, and quickly back it to steam icon. This will let the coffee bloom inside. After 57 seconds, slowly move the selector upto Espresso. The decoction should be not too slow or not too runny.4. Wait till your desired quantity is reached and quickly change the selector to steam mode.5.  Take milk in a tumbler which is slightly larger than the level of milk. Place the tumbler under the steam pipe such a way that the tip should immerse just slight under milk meniscus. Slowly open the steam valve located at the side. Steam it as per your need.6. Mix the milk and decoction. Thats itRemember to not uncap the top lid after usage as there may still be pressure inside. Open the steam valve and let all the pressure get released.Coffee used Bombay Island Espresso grind Medium Roast. Use only espresso grind or maybe south indian filter grind. Dont use Aeropress, V60 or any other grind as it may not produce desired taste.I personally like this machine. For the price its good and build quality is Moderate. Please watch some YouTube videos if you are new to coffee machines. Its very very easy to ruin coffee without proper knowledge. You may also watch James Hoffmann. He is World Barista Champion and shares tips about coffee.,Im a fan of espresso. Every time I go to a coffee joint, I tend to order a doppio A double shot espresso. But, those prices are way too high if I wished to drink a cup of espresso twice everyday. So, Ive decided to buy this machine. One thing to say, the quality and durability depends on the user. If you take care, the machine would take care of your cup of joe.So, how do you properly clean this thing is the question raised by many guests after seeing.1. Always rinse the drip tray2. Use 10 dish washing liquid with 90 water to clean the carafe3. Do not hit the filter basket to drop the used grounds. Run water over it forcefully to loosen the grounds. This is crucial because dents can affect quality4. Before and after your brewing activities, make sure that you clean the internals. To do this, fill the carafe till the 4 mark with bottled water.  Assemble an empty permafilter.  Switch on and set the strength to max. In about a minute, you can see steaming hot water flow into the carafe. Check its color. If its yellow, then rinse and repeat. If it is white, dry everything and switch it off. Then, either do your coffee brewing or assemble it back and call it a day.5. Always let the steam out. When you froth milk, immediately wipe off the residual milk with a lint free clothWARNING NEVER EVER USE HARDTAP WATER. IT CAUSES SERIOUS LIMESCALING ISSUES WHICH CAN GREATLY AFFECT THE TASTE, QUALITY OF YOUR COFFEE. IT MAY ALSO CAUSE DIGESTIVE ISSUES. ALWAYS USE SOFTCAN WATERTHE WATER MUST NOT TASTE SALTY OR SWEET.  TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. PLEASE DO NOT POST MISLEADING REVIEWS STATING THAT MY MACHINE BROKE.THE STEAM KNOB IS THE WORST PART OF THIS MACHINE. THE MACHINE WAS USED JUST FOR 14 DAYS. THEN, THE STEAM KNOB DECIDED TO LOOSEN UP AND FALL OFF. I CALLED THE SERVICE CENTER. THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT THERE. THE PROBLEM IS IM JUST 17, AND I CANT DRIVE. AND THE SERVICE CENTER IS FAR AWAY. SO, I REMOVED THE RUBBER CASKET AND FIXED THE KNOB DIRECTLY. IT COMES OFF, BUT I THINK ILL USE IT ONLY TO EASE THE PRESSURE, BECAUSE I ALWAYS DRINK IT BLACK. BUT THIS ISSUE MAKES ME REDUCE A STARTips for using the machine.1. Use fine grounded coffee. I use Narasus PB or Royal Elite Bold. Currently,  Im using Phalada Pure  Sure Organic Coffee Powder. For the best results, you must grind the coffee on your own. If you cant make sure the coffee is fresh. Mind that using instant coffee powder or using coffee mixed with chicory can lead to disaster, both for the machine and your stomach respectively. You can also go for Lavazza. But, it makes a hole in your wallet deeper than the Mariana Trench.2. Only use good quality bottledcan water.3. Maintain a good cleaning discipline4. In case youve used hardtap water, immediately do a descaling. Refer your instruction manual.5. Always tamp your ground in the filter. You must apply about 30 pounds of force. This is about 13 kg of force. Hold the force for about 6 seconds and slowly rotate the tamper before removing it. Make sure the filter lock is up when doing thisAs you can see, this is a real espresso maker. It produces crema provided that you use fresh and the correct coffee. For me, it produced about 4 mm crema for a double shot. This is good for a steam driven machine. Note that this is a steam driven machine. You can never get the finish of coffee joints, because they use dual boilers powered by thermoblock pumps. Although the tastes would be similar, provided you use the correct beans.Please look at the pics  to see the finish. The cirrus clouds like crema was from coffee powder a week old. The brown and rich crema is from that organic coffee powder Ive just bought. Can you notice the finish being directly proportional to the freshness This applies even to taste. The white crema cup tasted a bit bitter and left a bittery taste in my mouth. The brown crema cup tasted like coffee at its best, leaving a crisp and nutty taste. Also, after I did some research, I came to know that an espresso must have three layers. A bitter crema, a sweet middle and a nutty acidic bottom. You must mix these before drinking to have the best shot. If you see the glass picture Ive attached , you can clearly see those layers.OVERALL, THIS IS A GREAT ESPRESSO MACHINE FOR A BEGINNER. IT MAKES GREAT ESPRESSO AND IT IS ECONOMICAL TOO. AS I SAID, IF YOU TREAT THE MACHINE WELL, THE MACHINE WOULD TREAT YOUR CUP OF JOE WELL.,Being a coffee enthusiast, the product fits in my requirement.Easy to use. Time taken is reasonable. Adjustment of intensity works well.Frothing tool is very good... though i prefer black coffee, frothing helps getting a perfect creamy coffee for my guests.,Nice product,The coffee strength nob is a mythBut itne paise me itna is good,Very happy with the machine, works fine and easy to operate, unfortunately it wasnt packed very well buy the seller so the plastic spoon that came with the machine was broken , everything was packed in the original box with only one tape to secure the box.,It makes the whole process of making coffee more difficult. Also was shocked to know this is not covered under Amazons return policy. My bad I didnt check and now I am stuck with this. Life is no better after you buy this.,Coffee maker delivered without Warranty Card  Instruction manual",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31M+TYWPdQL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

Otherwise leakage will happen|Size Name: Free Size","How to choose an iron  This oneA decent combo of features  price.Cable quality not good though.,Quality Iron for power users with effective spray  steam function  Review  Guide  Tips,Doesnt remove hard wrinkles.,Easyto use but it leaks water,Very easy to use,Good product,Quick warm up,Not good","Update as on 28.10.2018The power cord has developed twists beyond repair and the seperate cores are now visible,the insulation pvc of the cores doesnt look very durable.I dont know why such standard manufacturers cant provide a decent durable cableThe iron however is performing flawlessly.Still disappointed ,as in coming weeks ill have to change the cable for sure.Reducing one star for compromising upon the cable quality by such a big brand name.HOW IT STARTED  THE NEED FOR AN IRONxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxRecently , my previous Bajaj make dry iron, which I received as a gift from somewhere, started giving problems after two years of occasional use  with not so careful handling and care. Initially, Its wires insulation inside was found rotten around the iron entry point which I repaired myself and later its thermostat started giving problems. Finally, its ON indication went OFF and I decided that it was time to bid goodbye to it and find a new one.Hence, my search for a reputed brand make , best value for money device began .Being from Electrical Engineering background  occupation, I fairly summed up my expectations from the power device as below1. DRY IRON VS STEAM IRON xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThis was fairly simple if we consider the explanation that a steam iron could perform as a dry iron but viceversa was not possible. Also, almost always you find some or the other stubborn wrinkles and crease distortions that is hard for the dry iron to overcome and you need to use water for the purpose.On the contrary, As the steam  loosens the individual fibres of the clothes, the steam irons pressing action smooths out wrinklesHence it was better to be  equipped with the facility in the first place in the device itself.2. BRAND REPUTATION  WARRANTYxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAs an average consumer, We are not wrong in generally assuming that products of bigger established brands have a higher quality and perform better. Rightfully so ,A brand which has been working with a product for decades has a plenty of experience  research regarding the possible points of failures of the product and can be surely trusted upon.Following the same footprints I thought not to take bets upon power devices like iron and go with the Super brands like Philips having decades of expertise in this field..Our product comes with a two year global warranty which is quite decent in my opinion .3. STEAM OUTPUT , STEAM BURST  VERTICAL STEAM FEATURExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxDuring normal usage with steam a delivery of anything above 8 gramsmin is okay but Some ironing jobs such as curtains or quilts require a much more supply of steam. In such cases the steam burst feature comes in handy. Users can push a button to receive a burst of steam when needed. More holes in the sole plate add  to the effectiveness of steam  supplied.Vertical steam feature in theory can direct clouds of steam  in and around vertically hung garments or curtains which eliminates wrinkles without the need for a pressing force.However in practical scenario and by virtue of  its design and water tank limitations , a steam iron is virtually incapable of  addressing the wrinkles like that and  hence paying more for such a feature is not advised.Use dedicated garment steamers for that purpose. Our Philips GC1905 comes with a variable setting for steam  output with a continuous delivery of  up to 17 gramsmin which is quite good.Additionally, It can provide steam burst too for stubborn wrinkles. Vertical steam feature is not available though.4. ELECTRICAL RELATED FEATURES WATTAGE, CORD,THERMOSTAT etc.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe simple maths that more watts means more heat or more steam or quick heating is not as simple as it looks.1. Surely, more watts means more heat generated but more wattage limits our ability to plug the iron at any socket in the house as for any power above 1500 Watts , I would suggest to only plugin to the power sockets.Going for more power demands must be backed up with careful examination as to whether you  really need that much heating if its normal clothes only that you need to iron most of the times.2. Surely, More heat developed  is capable to deliver more steam but that depends upon the number of holes in your sole plate for it to be really effective ,Your water holding tank size and lastly steam delivery settings.Generating too much steam without delivery can be dangerous as it can pressurize the system.3. Last but not the least  More power  doesnt always mean  quick heating as heating of the sole plate depends upon a number of factors like the material  thickness of the sole plate , Surface area of  the heating element used  inside the soleplate etc.Most of  these intricate details are variable in nature and cannot be specifically mentioned by the manufacturer. OUR PRODUCT Comes with a decent 1440 Watts of power good enough for routine casual use along with occasional use on heavier fabrics. Comes with a 250 Volts, 10 Amp  Max. rating of plug is always extra to actual amperage 3 pin Top which can  be easily plugged into our casual 6 amp sockets as well without any damage to the socket.Hence enhanced mobility  performance. The cord length is around 1.8 meters which is good enough for any practical lengths,Any more than that would be cumbersome to handle.. The cord  is braided with an insulated  cotton sleeve which is useful for twists as well as insulating during a cable damage.However in due course of use, the cord often develops rigid twists  turns beneath the cotton braiding which is hard to straighten out.So not so great on the cable quality terms. The cable only comes with 180 degrees of swivel movement, which is quite disappointing and I would  have  really wished if it was 360 degrees of cord freedom. The thermostat knob for temperature selection comes with regular 5 settings but going with a reputed brand like Philips always assures of a good quality of thermostat.After all, the thermostat is the heart and soul of modern day irons and must be highly durable and reliable. Lastly our product is an ISI marked product  which is quite an assurance for sure.5. SOLEPLATE MATERIAL  SHAPExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThis is probably the toughest part where each company claims to have the best and easy gliding soleplates.A variety of soleplates are available in the market today like nonstick Teflon coated ,aluminium plates with American  heritage coating, Steel plates with alloys or Ceramic coated.Each has its pros and cons. Teflon coated plates are easy to get scratched and gather dirt over a period of time. American Heritage is similar to Teflon and glides over the fabric even better. Stainless steel is the most durable and easy to clean however may stick to clothes on higher settings.Adds weight to the device. Metal works better than ceramic for pressing in sharp creases on sleeves and trousers. Good for smooth gliding and even heat distribution  but biggest advantage is to eliminate static charge at high temperatures which may cause clothes to stick.When  ironing on synthetics and fabrics blended with spandex, a ceramic iron will suit your needs best, as ceramic does not stick to these fabrics but the coating may peel off on rough handling. Aluminium soleplates heat up quickly but are prone to damage and may stick to clothes. Our Product comes with a linished soleplate which  is quite inadequate detail as linishing is a process of grinding or polishing a surface to make it a perfect flat. However apart from linishing stuff, I can surely say that the soleplate in our device is decent gliding but not the best gliding, Its heavy but doesnt stick to the clothes yet.For that matter I trusted  the brand reputation and went ahead with this linished soleplate. Stay away from Teflon coated ones though as its bound to wear off  fast.Regarding the shape , I honestly wanted  it to look like American fighter planes with sharp beak design and dark colors..LOL..However ,those models with my looks were weak in overall specs so had to settle down with this StillDecent Looking model.6. FEATURES LIKE ANTI DRIP ,ANTICALC, GRIPxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxTo tell you the truth these are more of a fancy terms rather than actual purpose  for most of the users. Presence of these features, isnt a problem  though , as in areas where the water comes hard, Anticalc may stir and clear the calcium build up ,if any in the water tank.However ,If you use proper water, drain it out timely , Do not fully fill the tank , allow it to heat before using steam   follow all procedures correctly, you wont actually need to use these features.Regarding Grip ,Many iron nowadays have some unique design which is set ergonomically to give a better grip. Our product comes with the anticalc function  and is decent to grip though I think not ergonomically, still nothing for a deal breaker and these are minor features to discuss upon.7. PRICE VS PERFORMANCExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxEven though I did not have any preset price tag in my mind  but still going over 2500 would have definitely felt extreme for a thing that I dont make use of that much. I bought it at a price of around 1200 bucks  for  all the features and performance it delivers  I think it is worth it.FINAL VERDICTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all , I would just say, that even though our product might not have the best  appealing looks or the best soleplate or  the best burst of steam or the best swivel of the cord , still, what it has is   a complete package of all the individual features clubbed together in a decent rightperforming way, which is hard to come by in an  individual model.,I got this one ondemand from mother. For a few days, she was insisting on buying one iron for daily chores. I was already researching iron for one of my friends. So this search did not last long. DEven earlier, Philips was the only name that came to my mind due to its consistency  product quality. I also had Bajaj, Usha, Morphy in the list. But trust in Philips did not let me go for any other brand.I got this Iron well in one piece and without any scratches on the soleplate.INSIDE BOXSteam Iron inside a poly packInstruction leafletWarranty cardABOUTWattage 1440 wattWeight 1 kgWater Capacity 180 mlCord length 1.8 meterIndicator onoff based on temperature settingMax Water level markingWarranty 2 yearsPROS1. Good quality iron with effective ironing  steaming.2. Body is solid with good finish overall at this range.3. Linished Teflon coated soleplate for easy gliding on all fabrics. Gliding is somewhat limited in steam mode due to moisture.4. Sufficiently long cable with swivel joint at iron for easy movement and usage.5. Capacity of the water tank is sufficient for average steaming operation 30 min or more in one fill.6. Spray function is well designed, it evenly sprays water and not just throws a fine jet of water.7. The spray function produces a fine mist that evenly moistens the fabric, making it easier to iron out tough creases.8. Wattage 1440w is sufficient enough for home usage and can easily cover tough wrinkles and heavy clothes.9. Easy and fast filling of the tank owing to the huge filling hole.10. Easy and complete emptying of the water tank owing to the large hole, and the sideways opening door.11. Weight on the ok side, not a lightweight but not even heavyweight. Some weight is useful as it helps ironing by applying pressure on the cloth. Empty iron is lightweight only.CONS1. Steam control knob looks loose at first, but it works well in the long run.2. Water movement during iron creates jerks and affects smooth operation. But thats the way it will work  you cant do anything.3. For regular lightweight iron users, it will appear bulky at first. But you get used to it in a few days.4. No steam burst function in this model GC1905 but you get what you pay for. Cons are temporary and dont affect functionality in the long run.

Use RO filtered water if possible as its low in hardness and will ensure the longevity of iron without choking the vents or orifices.2. let the iron heat properly before use. Leakage has been observed if one uses the Iron without heating properly as water will directly pass from vents without getting converted to steam.3. Gently clean soleplate and dont use any hard material or chemicals.4. Emptying water tank every time after usage is recommended to avoid scaling problem. As calcium deposits are more in standing water.5. Untangle  straighten the cord once after every use before storage. As these cords tend to develop sharp irrecoverable turns over time and those are hot zones for cable failure.6. When not using steam function keep the steam knob in off position.7. Use calc clean mode once in 2 weeks if using normal tap water with medium hardness. If water is very hard, increase the frequency or if using RO water decrease frequency.8. Once in a few months clean steam control needle using vinegar. To remove the needle, rotate the knob to calc clean mode and gently pull it out.9. Last but most important, use a properly earthed wall socket for iron to avoid shocks.CALC CLEANING MODEThis iron has a calc cleaning mode to descale it. To do so follow the steps below1. Keep knob in the steam off position.2. Fill tank to max level.3. Rotate temperature dial to max position and wait for the indicator to go off.4. Take out socket from mains and move iron to sink.5. Turn the steam knob to calc clean position and pull it up a few cms.6. Let all water be used up.7. Steam and hot water come out along with calcium deposits. The principle behind this function is a sudden change in temperatures of inside zone, which leads to contraction  expansion resulting in scaling shredding and flush out.CLARIFICATION DAMAGE TO BODY OR PLATE  OTHER ISSUES concerns raised by other usersSeveral users posted about the damaged product or soleplate on arrival and other usage issues. Let me put my insights into those. I had no issue with the quality of the product delivered. It arrived in proper condition without any damage anywhere, as proper care was taken for this using air cushions. Maybe their seller was careless enough and that resulted in damage during transit. Soleplate had no marks on it. Yes, here Philips can provide a protective sticker or film on the plate which will reduce the ratio of complaints, for the damaged sole plate on arrival. Temperature dial works properly and markings are intact after months of usage. Slight difference in color tone maybe there across different zones, as different materials are used as per requirement. Say hot zone near plate vs cold zone at back. Leakage will be there if the steam knob is in steam position and iron is not sufficiently hot to convert incoming water. So its passed directly,  appears as leakage. Philips has explicitly mentioned this in product details. Remember to order it from a reputed seller. Check seller ratings, reviews and amazon verified tag to avoid any issues, like the faulty product, duplicate product, etc.DONT GET CONFUSED Theres No Steam Burst Mode Here1. Some of the photos displayed are with steam burst function symbol on the button  even some users have mentioned this in their reviews, but it is not present in this model. Models with the said function have two buttons for spray  burst instead of one here for spray only.2. Also, steam output at one place is 13gmin, another place 17gmin. Its actually 17gmin.FINAL VERDICT If you are looking for good quality, durable steaming iron in the 1.5k range, Philips is the name you should seek for. This model of Philips has got good build quality  features which are more than enough for an average home user. So at any point, you can go for this model. If on a lower budget 1k range you can go for Philips GC1011 1200w or Bajaj MX 3 1250w but both are low power and Philips one misses steam spray function too. But still, both will cover most of the usage pattern of a home user. Heavy users may go for Philips EasySpeed Plus GC2040 2100w or BlackDecker BD BXIR2001IN 2000w or Morphy Richards Super Glide 2000w in 2k range.NOTE Unlike regular lightweight irons, steam irons generally dont go easy with repairs. Unlike regular iron, If the coil is damaged in the steam iron whole of the bottom plate needs to be replaced  if you are out of warranty it will cost you a lot. In fact, for the cost of the plate plus a few bucks, you get a new iron. So, check your requirement for regular vs steam iron  choose wisely.,I tried removing hard wrinkles of a jeans but it couldnt remove them properly. They were still visible even after using the steam.,Easyto use but it leaks water,Very good,Its a good product,Iron is good and the best delivery with few hours, just this iron doesnt have a stream burst...rest is good,Simple cloth iron",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41Xp77o+-YL._SX300_SY300_.jpg

Unfortunately this product doesnt have that option and my purchase went for a complete waste.,First things firstIts not bad heater and it provides plenty of warmth.However, the unit I received had one major, or rather fatal, issue. Current was passing through its entire body, be it the front grill or the area near the handle in the back. You cant hold it without getting an electric shock when its running. If you have to turn the knob or simply move it from one position to another, you would need to unplug it from the power source first. Otherwise it can be fatal. If you use it in the night, you have to keep it out of your reach otherwise if you wake up at night to drinking water or anything else, you might accidentally touch it and die. Homes with children needs to be extra protective.Now I am not sure whether this fault is only in my unit or a general problem with these type of heaters.

Im genuinely surprised.First of all, Id give this a 3.55 instead of the 4 but I rounded it up instead of down because theres more to like than dislike.Product was delivered promptly but the packaging was in rough shape. When I unpacked it, the keyboard had three missing keys iirc it was left Alt, Z and the Windows keys. I turned over the box and dumped everything and voila! The missing keys fell out. Not off to a great start but I slapped those keys on which was very straightforward meaning that replacing keycaps in the future will be relatively easy and plugged in the receiver to my laptop. No setup or 3rd party software necessary, it just started working instantly. Pretty seamless.I only use the keyboard when I connect my laptop to my TV and Im sitting at a distance, I use my laptops keyboard otherwise. I absolutely love the keyboard. I was expecting it to feel wonky and cheap but it actually feels decent. Its not super premium but its much better than what I was expecting for the price. It has flip stands on the back to raise it and an onoff switch if you want to conserve battery. The keys themselves are full sized, and as someone with larger hands, I really appreciate it. The curve around the space bar looks cool but I dont think it adds anything ergonomically. The typing experience is nice, the keys have enough feedback to them not mechanical levels obviously, but still satisfying enough. The Caps Lock key has a little raised bit to it so you can feel it without looking at it and dont accidentally hit it while typing, neat little addition. The shortcutmedia keys on top all work fine with Windows 11. Theres not much else to say about the keyboard. It should be more than sufficient for everyday officebrowsingschool tasks and will be good and comfy for people who type a lot. Do not buy this expecting a gaming level keyboard with antighosting, etc or buy it expecting to have the durability of a true mechanical keyboard. I was initially going to mark it down for not having any backlight at all but given the budget, thats understandable and acceptable. Overall, I very much like the keyboard and find it to be above par for what you pay.The mouse, on the other hand no pun intended, is mediocre at best. The build quality is not good it does not feel good when you use either of the click buttons, you can feel the inner mechanisms groaning, like its gonna fall apart at any time. The mouse also starts lagging randomly. The lag only lasts a couple of seconds but it occurs enough to be an annoyance. Also, it just doesnt feel good in your palm. I have an Amazon Basics mouse that I purchased while I was in the US for 7 520rs and that thing feels so much sturdier and better built than this. It also has no lagging issues and the clicks feel smooth even after a few years of use.As an overall package, I would say its decent for the price. There are lots of other sets in this price range and I picked this literally because of the Logitech branding since I own a few other Logitech products and enjoy them a lot. The keyboard is doing all the heavy lifting here and carrying its mouse friend. I hope they improve the mouse going forward because then, this would be the best combo in this range. As it stands right now, its fairly indistinguishable from its competitors.Recommended for  people looking for an affordable wireless set for everyday computer work and people who type a lot.Not recommended for  gaming or any form of power users. It might work for single player games like city builders, grand strategy, RTSes, etc but I would not recommend it for any form of shooters, especially online. The mouse simply isnt up to task.,,The Keyboard is good and working nice. for me the Mouse is too small and not able to use properly and getting pain after using for very less time only. it will be good if the mouse is in regular size. Also the mouse is lagging a bit even after changing the settings.,I using this product since one year not any problem found.Even battery cell not change,I dont really know if its worth the cost or not. But, I mainly prefer silent typing and mouse clicks. Ergonomic is also a must as I use these for long hours.Currently, I use logitech m590 mouse which is really awesome and makes almost no noise at all.,Great Product,I have been using this product for 2years. Its battery is great, still running. The keys could get hard with time, therefore i had to use WD40 to lubricate them. After 2years, some random keys have stopped working, such Del, Semicolon, Numpad3. The mouses right click isnt functioning anymore. The left click has irritating double click issue. So not suited for FPS games. Speed and connection is adequate, no lag noticed. The keyboard collects a lot of dust so better to cover it. Ergonomics are great no issue with that. If youre looking for a longer size keyboard for approx. 2years of proper functioning for daily or official use, then it is a good purchase. Mouse is small and comfortable, even for left handed people. Keep in mind the keys WILL become stiff over time.,I purchased it for my personal use , which includes mostly working, it has good connectivity both for keyboard and mouse . I have not faced any issue with it. I have not tested its performanace.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41X6hey-ExL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

What I like the most is how easy is to keep because of the connector. The color options are neatly wide, and I like it. I would say though its not very smooth of you use it for color filling, it does get smudge if you double coat it. So, there you have to be careful and also you cant order just one, it has to be two set minimum to be delivered. Thats the drawback. Otherwise, its good overall.,Eays to use for kids above 6 years,simply good,The connectors provided help to keep all the pens together. These are fine tipped pens and hence can be used for mandala designs. Just remember not to overlap and colour as this may leave a smudge.,Colour pay off is good....In this price great product,Its good for beginnersThe best part about these are that they can connect so they are easy to carry them.,Good buy for the price during discount.

Philips Viva Collection HD492801 2100Watt Induction Cooktop with Feather Touch Sensor and Crystal Glass Plate ,Philips Domestic Appliances is Asia’s most trusted brand(As per Research by ibrands360 & WCRCINT. Category: Home Appliances.),"Product as describe,Good product,Good product but price high.,I miss my gas stove.... Induction sucks ,Great value,No1,    ,Good","I recvd product within 3 dys while owing to rural area other product tks 10 dys to deliver n product recvd at gd condition n works well, aftr use if smthng cms up will review again,It works good. Nice heating. But hard to clean as it has ridges and small gap between the hot plate and the controls and also below the plate edges.. Other than that, fine product,2500 se jyada price nahi hona chahiye tha. Use karne mein bahut achha hai,Over all Im really disappointed by the product and especially cooking experience. I was used to normal gas and it was easy to regulate to propper temperature. This product has only like 8 temperature settings and it is either too hot or too cold and cannot be set in middle. For example when I set 160C then it is burning toasts and onions... When I set one step lower it is 130C and it is not enough for frying .Also you need to buy more expensive induction friendly cookware. And even when I invest to expensive Tefal pan it heat mostly in the center and it is much colder on the edges... You can see on pictures that watter boiling only in middle, and toast being burnt in middle and raw outside  The pan is very good and has induction area over whole bottom so Im sure the fault is in this philips stove... You can see the pan from bottom that induction area is almost over whole bottom... Also due to fact that only center is hot then frying onions is taking much longer than on normal gas stove where heat is better distributed  And even though you spent more time frying the onions the result is worse... Onion is little burned from outside and still not soft inside... Im really disappointed by frying experience compared to gas stove...There is one positive side and that is that heating is quick. My pressure cooker star whistling quite quickly. Faster than on gas stove. Also you can set time for like 10 minut and leave it which is quite convenient...Controll is easy. But I hate details. First I love one detail. There is pause button which is very cool. If something heats too quickly or you just need to quickly do something else you press pause button and there is no new heat  It is much nicer compared to gas stove where you would need to turn off, light up again and then find right flame again... Here you just press pause again and cook as before... But that is only thing that I love. Otherwise I hate how it is designed.... First basiclly whole top row of buttons is useless. Those buttons are preset temperatures. But anyway those temperatures are wrong or just for items you do not cook... Like there is stirr fry button and it set 180C. It totally burns onion... I set usually 180C for beginning and then soon change for 160C. But even 160C is too much burning... But lower setting is only 130C which is not frying at all. I would need like 150C I guess and it is impossible to set  ...Also I noticed another issue that stove is sometimes making automatic pauses. It heats and than probably when it thinks it is too hot then it stop completelly and in like 10 seconds starts again. So instead of consistentn temperatures it is doing on and off.But back to controll. Except from fact that preset temperatures are useless when you want to change temperature it wont let you or let you to do only one  but not 2 times . Why I dont know probably ill will... You need to first press manual button which change temperature completely to 130C and only then you can freely press  and set your desired temperature. So basically I never use any preset mode and I always only press manual and  to set my temperature...Another control is setting time. I must say satting time is useful feature and I love it, but how it is implemented I hate. When you press time button then by default it set 30 minutes... Ok but when you hold  button it jumps so quickly that in one second it counts to 0 and roll to 3 hours.... Holding incrementdecrement is so quick that it is useless. It must have implement some idiot... Anyway you can always click one by one. So to set 10 minutes you must click time button and then click 20 times minus button to set 10 minutes... It is doable but pretty annoying. Or I long press  it usially jumps directly to 3 hours and then I press 11 times ...  Still anoying but I save like 8 clicks... What is super idiotic is that when I want to add 5 minutes I click time and it by default set 30 minutes again  Arrrrggghhhhh.... So instead of just click time and 5 times  I need to click 25 times  .... Really this must have done some idiot.... Another unpleasant thing is that if you need to change temperature you can not... Imagine something starts burning and you need to wait like 3 seconds and not pressing  and then after those 3 seconds time setting mode is automatically left and it will let you change temperatures again... When controlling  stupidity is burning my food it makes me angry So over all I would buy anything else next time... Maybe it will be worse but I would at least try...Anyway to say something positive at the end I like that product looks quite durable and material quality looks good. Packaging was also well. But power cable is only like 1.2 meters.... That might be too short... But for me just enough... Also I like mechanic buttons, some stove has capacity buttons which is cool looking and totally flat but I like to feel the press and the click. Buttons are under foil so there is no risk of something leaking into them. Cleaning is very easy cos it is almost flat  Cleaning experience is much better than cleaning gas stove...,Product is good but service center problem not available nearly.,No1,    ,Ordered 3 one was faulty",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Bnylq337S._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Only cons is 1st time connection is Lil messy. Once it connected no need to look back,Value for money bought it for around 1300 on sale, quick  easy to install  good coverage.,,bought this as wifi was not working in my room due to placement of router. was very doubtful to buy as it was pricey as per my view but once you buy you can take it with you when you move or shift so its a forever product. strength of wifi is so good now i can watch lectures. just install app. you can also add or remove people  who uses it. very manageable.,I bought this as a backup extender. Setting it up was a breeze but I faced a silly selfinflicted issue. I entered wrong WiFi password during setup but setup completed as if the connection to the router was successful. When I tried to browse, it showed no internet connection between the extender and the router. It took me some time to troubleshoot and correct the password. Ideally, the setup process should have highlighted the error and stopped the setup process showing the connection to the router was not successful, it would have saved me some headache to troubleshoot.Extender CoverageI use the extender to reach a corner of the house about 45ft away from the router where I get sporadic and weak signal 5MBPS. I locate the extender about 30ft away from the router to extend the network and now I get a connection of 20MBPS. It is enough for my work.Speed Test Results At the time of testing, my laptop recorded a speed of 90MBPS next to the router. At the point where I located the extender 30ft away, when directly connected to the router, the laptop recorded a speed of 30MBPS . At the same point when connected to the extender, the laptop recorded a speed of 27MBPS, only 10 drop not so bad. 15 feet away from the extender without direct line of sight, the laptop recorded 21MBPS.Overall, I am satisfied with its performance., for home use but its Range is like till one room only it can extend, not much, but good one, like my router is in middle passage in my home but its range doesnt come out much without extender , when i started using extender it pulls the Range till this specific room, if your room is one after the other then it wont go till last room .,Extends my wifi signals and does it job very effectively.  Once concern is i have 5g actfiber signal but this gives 2.5 hz only but still managable for tv laptop mobiles etc for home purpose.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31aoDL5YfNL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

An oil heater is best that you can buy, but that is worth spending for places where the weather will be colder for more than 3 months and well below 10 deg. For normal winter uses, I recommend buying Convection type heaters with fan and Thermostat. Please avoid conduction based ones They can consume less power, cheap but they are very slow, plus burns oxygen. Also note, whichever you buy make sure it has a Thermostat setting!Product ReviewThis product from USHA is a convection type room heater, and I have listed the below features and information. Twin Blade fan Thermostat builtin Like AC, will turn onoff as per temp changes 1000W2000W operation 2000W means faster heating Fan only mode for normal table fan type! Cant adjust speed ONOFF Power LED when it operates Fan noise is high and a bit annoying if your room is very calm 15A Power plug and 1m cord length Retracting stand to elevate height about 2 inches 1 year warranty for the productThe room heater uses a powerful fan to spread the heat. No Swing option, very directional. You must position it correctly and securely. The Thermostat option is good to have, and I suggest buyers to buy with thermostat, as this will help reduce your EB bills, as well as give comfortable weather inside. The thermostat is not very accurate, like in Air conditioners but works. The user manual gives clear information about using it.How to set up Power on, select 1000w2000w The switch is not easy to operate Set to thermostat switch to MAX Anticlockwise Let the heater run till you feel comfortable Warm inside Reduce the thermostat slowly till the point where the unit turns off Leave that setting undisturbed and let the heater ON till morning Note, if you have mistakenly set it wrongly, turnoff and turnon. Once again follow the same step above.I use this for my sleeping room which is about 12x12 size. In Bangalore, it is about 2021 deg at night and can drop low in another few weeks, and it took about 2030 minutes to bring it 2627 deg with 1000w in almost closed room. Please note, if your place has a room temperature Not outside temp well below and it not exposed to sunlight, then it will take a long time to reach comfortable temperature. In such cases only use 2000 W setting. It does not burn oxygen but reduces relative humidity which can cause dryness, so keeping a bucket or a better a tray of water will help. But you must keep your window slightly open, never use it on a closed room.5A or 15AI see this as a main problem, as in many of our houses, we only have 15A for Washing machines and AC socket which is not easily reachable. This unit can only be plugged into 15A socket. The reason is, when you operate a 230v, unit with 5A socket, you can only draw a maximum of 1150 Watts 230v x 5A from that socket. However, since this unit operates also at 2000W, it requires 15A, as that could only provide up to 3000W 230v x 15A like ACs, etc. However, you can safely use this unit from a normal 5A socket ONLY IF YOU ARE USING AT 1000W ALWAYS. Just buy a 5A to 15A converter socket and use this. Do not worry, it will work just fine, but never use 2000W though If you house has MCB Tripper, then its much safe.Tips Always keep some space from all 4 sides of the heater unit First try with fan unit for 10 minutes before using for heater Using after a long storage  Keep a window slightly open for fresh air Air can feel dry after sometime, can cause nose irritation and dryness. Room must be ventilated, adding water tray can helpDrawbacks1. Fan noise, sometimes unbearable in a calm room2. Average Build quality and finishingFinal wordsI recommend this product, a cheap and effective unit for a small to medium size rooms and it does not burn oxygen, but makes dry air which can easily be overcome. The prices could drop around 1700 sometimes, so please check price before buying. Thanks for reading this, if you have any doubts, comment below.,On first Day , I had faced some minor problem in this product but day after that day till now it working with no minor and major issues. I am happy on this product .,Good, purchased this Usha 812T heater which got delivered to me on 29th Dec 21. We use it moderately for just 34 hrs in day.It was working fine for 18 days. However,on 19th day i.e on 16Jan22 night, after around half an hour of running it suddenly started making khad,khad,khad... sound and all its coil were red hot. Since we were awake, I just switched off the power from main switch. It could have resulted into burning or fire, if I would have delayed for few more seconds.When I picked up the heater in hand, it looked some part was loosened inside.Then on the next day, on 17th Jan 22, I lodged a complaint with Usha customer care, na di was told the technician will visit within 48hrs. However, no one came in 48 hrs. So I called up the technician on the number shared to me by Usha on 19th. After that technician visited me. Upon checking he found that out of 2 fans, one fan has loosened completely and fallen inside, that is why it was making sound and coils were getting too much heated.I was relaxed that its not a big problem and would be fixed quickly. But to my surprise, the plastic coupler to which the fan was screwed, is not able to hold the screw tightly. There was a problem with the coupler. What kind of quality it is that within few days of usage screw automatically loosenrd and coupler not able to hold it anymoreAdding to my surprise, the technician was not having the new coupler for replacement. He said he will check tomorrow and come back of part is available. But he didnt came back. When I called next day, he said part is not available and has informed the company, but cant say when it will be available.So I called Usha customer care again, and they said yes techinician has reported part is not available na dwe are forwarding your request to service team to arrange the part asap.Since then I have been calling Usha Customer care as well techinician everyday and both are throwing the ball on each other.Usha customer care is worst saying everytime that they are forwarding the request to concerned department and as soon as the part is available it will be replaced. I asked them how many days it may take as I cant keep on waiting for a month, they just said they cant say when it would be available.Since it is too cold nowadays, and heater is not working what is the use of purchasing this Usha heater.If they will replace it after a month, winter would have already passed by then.This is a worst after sale service from big brand like Usha, and it was not expected from Usha. If they dont have the basic parts available with the service center, what is the use of sending technician empty handedFrom now on, I will never recommend Usha to anyone, and if any Usha representative is reading this post, I request to them to service my heater asap.Thanks,Go ahead ,The cord is very short and required 16 amp plug point. It eats up available oxygen in closed room,Using since one year , found fit for house use.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41A8H7PSidL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Camlin Elegante Fountain Pen  BlackBlueRed,Handcrafted with Gold plated nib|Brass Cap Chrome body|Elegant design,"Good Pen at Low Cost,... have been reading about this pen which I would like to answer,Decent at this price,Very nice.,Not for speedy write...,Nice pen good quality could be more smoother,Smooth,Superb Fountain Pen for all types of users","First of All Delivery of Amazon It was as specified no delays. Hence, appreciate it.Packaging Not Good. The box was tempered, torn and damaged.Product Ordered Black, received brown. Didnt replace as the Color didnt much mattered. Issue is with the seller though.Performance The pen of good. Robust, feels cheap however, looking at the price not to complain. Writes smooth.For anyone who wants to enter into fountain pens, can start with this as it does the job.Edited Have been using this pen for over 3 days now, I am facing issue of nib dryness. If I dont use the pen for sometime. The pen doesnt write at all. I have to wet the nib or do something or the other in order to make it start writing. It writes great when it starts writing. But the initial pick up is really bad. I have a platinum preppy too. Its a better option to go with if the budget is tight. However, there we have good writing but bad looks.,Few points I have been reading about this pen which I would like to answer. Compared with two other pens Parker Vector and Luxor V51. Grip  Read in couple of reviews regarding the thick grip and the curve at the grip which makes it awkward to hold. Honestly, have not felt so at all. The grip is pretty medium, larger than Parker Vector and comparable to the Luxor V5. It wont create any problems holding it. I am an average 510 and people of same build, hand and finger size wont be any problem. Also on Parker Vector the metal body starts to feel slippery due to metal, small grip and feels tiresome after writing couple of pages. Been nice to hold the Elegante and feel firm in hand, it makes one feel like holding a pen with substance  .2. Nib and feeder  It says Fine on the nib and it is comparable to the Luxor V5 0.5 and Parker Fine nib. Few claim it is 0.7  medium kinds. Its all about the pressure on puts when writing it. I just touch the nib on paper and rest the pen does, so would say it is Fine. It is way too smoooooother and fluent than Parker which felt a bit rough. Parker Fine nibs give a feedback making it bit of a dragging experience. However on Elegante the nib just flows and slides over the paper. It is not only the nib but also the feeder which ensures the nib slides. The feeder ensures that there is even flow of ink through out the writing experience. The writing it leaves is slightly wet and not dry, personally i prefer that over the dry and dragging. This ensures that one gets to write about 6 pages i.e 12 sides without a refill.3.  Plastic construction and feel in hand  The cap is made of brassas they say. The cap has a matte finish, not a glossy one. The clip and top is glossy. Gives a fair enough good contrast to add some looks to it when taking it out of the pocket D . The pen itself very much plastic. If I try to weigh both the cap and pen separately, roughly they feel of same weight, it is that light weight  just a feel factor how I felt. However this does not mean it is a cheap construction. It has fallen from 2 floors down and did not crack anywhere, so would say its good strong plastic. It makes one feel pretty solid holding it. The size if compared to other two is larger. It rests pretty well in between my thumb and index fingerwhich parker does not, Luxor does , hence never needed to put the clip on the rear. Without the clip it is very much balanced Parker and Luxor both feel well balanced without the cap placed on top , with clip Elegante and Parker feel a bit top heavy.4. Ink filling  Personally always been a fan of eyedroppersgood old school days , however this comes with the standard piston filling as seen in the photo by Hari. When I immersed the nib in the pen and pulled the piston it just filled half. Had to dip the whole nib till the grip when it got filled. In parker just dipping the top nib was sufficient. For Luxor pulling the whole top part out and then refuel it seemed very tedious. Some other reviews I read people have tried removing the piston converter and used it as eyedropper!!! Few said it worked , few said it leaked. Need to substantiate it. Not sure and hence wont try this out to spoil such a nice piece. If anyone has tried would love to hear your experience.5. Writing after 3 weeks  For Luxor, it works immediately! Even after 6 months it worked like magic. For Parker bit of dipping, or couple of splashing out and it starts. For Elegante it did not start immediately. From school days used to have an Airmail unfortunately misplaced it when i shifted it used to work like a beauty even after 3 weeks. Elegante on this aspect did not fair so well. However, how many of us are not going to use their Pen for 3 weeks, always something to write, sign or pen down  . It worked fairly after a break of one week.6. Colour  Personally the looks of a pen hardly matter to me. Its the balance in hand and the nib which are the real heart and soul. We pay crazy on high class pens just for the looks. For few people this matters more individual choice and nothing against it.  Parker gives a good classy look, Luxor makes one feel more of a student than a person with authority or executive. Elegante would be a mix of both and middle of both. Neither a college going look nor an Executive look. On looks it does fair enough justice The cap and two metal rings is all that makes it stand apart. Would have loved if they would have made more colours than Maroon, Black and Blue. Nonetheless these colours are the royal colours and pretty good than what Reynolds have bright designs which are more for school going kids to attract them. This does enough for me.7. Spare Nibs and feeder  Not sure if there are spare nibs available online. I am at a location which is 100s of km away from any civilization in a jungle or a desert and only way is to order online thankfully speed post delivers faster than couriers lticaptd  . After using this nib, I would personally not place any other nib. I am pretty happy about it. always good habit to have spare nibs, dont know when one drops it and needs to change.8. Recommended for  Its a must for student. At this price range where one is still studying and not earning, this sounds a good buy, though not the best as Luxor beats this is VFM. Parker, would never recommend it for students. If someone wants to carry it for exams carry 2 atleast, all due to the limited piston converter capacity. Luxor would be best. If you are an executive sitting in a board of meetings where you want to make a statement by what you carry then there are many other alternatives. This is fair on looks and pleasure for writing      .9. Value for Money  For a standard person like me or a student, Luxor beats Elegante and Parker. However for a fountain pen This is an excellent VFM Well, this sums up my experience after using it. Anyone has anything more to add to this or share their side we all would love to hear it, First of all, it came in a really bad condition. The package was almost flattened. All thanks to the people connected with the transition and delivery. Thank God it doesnt have any dent. Secondly, it is probably a used product. Because it came with the smell of ink in it out of the box. Thirdly, the brand claims that it is having a fine nib, but probably according to the European standards. I am a Pilot lover, so I know what fine nib is. This is medium sized nib at its best according to the standards of Pilot. Using a pen with fine nib is like having a perfect orgasm. You remember the experience for a long time. The handwriting also becomes better. Thats lacking in this pen. Thankfully it doesnt squirt ink every now and then like most of the other cheap fountain pens. I had two Wingsungs. Those were unbearably squirty. Fourthly, the grip is average. Fifthly, if you are a beginner, you may go for it, as it will obviously let you get used to the fountain pens. You may use it as a day to day pen.BUT DONT STICK WITH THIS ONE ONLY. EXPLORE THE WORLD OF PILOT IF YOU HAVE THE BUDGET. TRUST ME, YOU WONT LOOK BACK TO A PEN LIKE THIS. I WAS GIFTED A PILOT CROCODILE FINE NIB BY MY MOM. I WANT TO KEEP MY MEMORIES WITH THIS PEN SAFE. SO I DONT USUALLY USE THAT. THATS WHY IVE BOUGHT THIS ONE. Lastly and most importantly, a suggestion to the buyers, to make your pen experience ergonomic, please dont put the cap on the backside. Open the cap, keep it aside and unleash your writing...,very nice pen., its really amazing very smooth writing.thank you seller  amazon.,Its not for speedy writing, if you are use for signature its cutting off character,...., Some time spread over ink. And some time character cutting.... Cheap plastic product but at a 200 good for beginners.,Ive been using this pen for about 3monthsprosBuild quality for this price is amazinggold Nib looks amazingconsNib comes out easily,Just that the neck area of the pen was little broad for me to get used to ..,Guys I have started using fountain pens again a few months back. I had used all types of fountain pens during my school days like COLLEGE brand eye droppers, Camlin, Parker made in USA, Hero China made. Recently I am using Platinum Preppy which is very smooth and excellent pen and yes expected since it is Japan made. This the Camlin Elegante is our very own Made in India pen. It makes us proud. Just superb pen. Very smooth. It is actually a no nonsense pen. Only thing...since I had read a few negative reviews about this...I am using it with PILOT BLUE ink. I dont know whether ink quality is further improving its performance or what Whatever it may be.....This pen with Pilot ink combination rocks...just superb experience of writing with THE FOUNTSIN PEN. Thank you Camlin and Thank you Amazon",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/21C8ziy-IJL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Paper quality  nice, I used Ball pens, Sketch pens and also inkpens. all cases no soaking of ink.2. Binding  Spiral Binding and qality is good and attractive.3. Sturdiness  Here it could have been a little better, considering the price tag.4. Light Weight  Binding and Paper quality is nice, still lite weght. Thats a Plus.5. Writing Experience  Better than average available notbooks in similar pricetag.,First off, the notebook design is great, pages are nice and smooth, but a bit on the thinner side. The subject dividers are thicker than other pages.The QC has some issues, as of the one unit i ordered for testing this product 118 rs some pages were folded up from the corners and become larger when unfolded as depicted in the picture above. Many pages were glued onto each other hence, tearing some part when flipping them again, illustrated in the picture added above.Its an absolute steal deal for rs 118 per piece as no other notebook competes in the spiral bind 300 page market, and notebooks of about 200 pages non spiral bound of a simillar size are sold for 84 rs as of writing this review.The only downside I found besides the QC is that it doesnt include an index page, otherwise it has some games, riddles and a notes pages like other notebooks and the first page is dedicated to the owners details and contact N.O. Great to see it present.Overall i recommend this product because of the value for money and the quality. I understand my unit was a one off as other reviews dont seem to mention this. Will update after using this for a few more weeks,The product is worth the money. The paper quality was good and it has six separations for six different subjects.,Valu for moneyPremium quality,,I ordered 3, only one copy was a bit damaged from the binding.,I got all the same design notebook. Which is Little disappointing me. Except that everything is fine!,Good product",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419KXo-7kDL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

The best features once you pair your 3 different devices to this keyboard using bluetooth, switching connectivity is super fast  like you wont feel any lag in connectivity. The instructions strap helps to well understand this product. I bought at 2.6k, but I know its price had dropped to 1.7K during Diwali Sale.Things I hate about this product  I felt it would be lightweight but it isnt. Buttons are rounded but yes gives mechanical keyboard feel which is great For gaming, buttons are too close to each other so your hands will take sometime to adjust and also the arrow keys are slim which dont matter because as gamer you rarely use arrow keys its always WASD, but yes will be problematic if you play FIFA where there is extreme usage of arrow keys.So, 45 for overall experience.,Good portable keyboard. I can list out the pros and cons.Pros 1. Good Connectivity with Macbook pro latest OS2. Macbook keys are mapped properly as expected.3. Portable4. Simultaneous connectivity with 3 devicesCons1. Not an ergonomic keyboard. Its flat and doesnt have any option to incline up.2. Dont have backlight keys. You can not see the keys in dark room.3. Keys are slightly hard to press, I think due to rubber dome.4. Enter key, I feel, is smaller which cant be sensed without seeing the keyboard.Overall, my purpose got fulfilled as i am able to use it with my Macbook pro after struggling with logitech R270 combo.,The keyboard is really good and it has a good built quality and the only con is that there is no indication of whether the caps lock is on or off.,Pros easy to use, keys feels like mechanical keyboard. Can connect 3 devices. Supports Mac and windows. Place holder for mobile devices  However, I use it to place a penCons Expensive. Very heavy  feels like Macbook air. There is lag in connection whenever you turn on your laptop.,price is litter high,What an excellent product I got my hands on. Smooth working and connect to 3 different gadgets at the same time and u can work on any of them. Buttons are of good size so typing is easy and fast. The inbuilt holder for gadgets is really solid and helping. And its connect to IPhone also.,Only uses for typing if horizontal view is suitable to see what we typingThink twice before buying,Not working properly on macbook pro! Switches to junk characters frequently which is really frustrating!How did I fix The keyboard switches to symboljunk characters when the option key is pressed. So, I had to disable the option key in the keyboard and live with it!Apart from that above problem, Its a good looking keyboard. The keys are smooth to handle. Due to its container for tabletphones, the product is not as compact as you might be expecting.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41hzQslWQlL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

This mouse is built like a tank,GAMING MASTERPIECE REVIEW AFTER 1 WEEK,Amazing mouse, bad cable,Too Heavy for anything,Best gaming mouse on a budget,Amazing Mouse","its really good product for gamers i would recommend it,Good mouse overall. Price is little high,I have been using this mouse since 2019, and I have to say, logitech built quality is second to none.I have throwed, and bashed this mouse on my table during my gaming sessions, yet this mouse still survives.Even the rubberised grips are still there. Go for it without any hesitation.For those having button issues, I have so far, replaced my left click and middle click button . I started developing these issues after 2 years . Its a simple soldering job to fix it. You can get replacement switches from tanotis. Now they work as good as new.,,So Ive been using this mouse for quite a long time and believe this is the best mouse so far Ive ever used. But the problem is with the cable, as another customer said the cable quality is not good the outer portion of cable from usb and from mouse side coming out and the inside wires can be visible. Even though mouse runs good but this is not good for long term usage. Other than this is pretty good mouse we have.,At close to 150g, it is ridiculously heavy for fastpaced gaming. For chill RPG titles itll do fine, but if you wanna play something like Apex Legends on this, forget it. The shape of the mouse is super comfortable, only mouse Ive owned that didnt give me any wrist pain even after 45 hours continuous usage. Cable quality is what you expect, like its not even braided. Since, its an older generation mouse, it doesnt have the doubleclicking issue Logitech is infamous for.After all that, I would say in 2022, just dont buy it, its too old to justify spending any money on.,You know and love Logitech. This is one of their best products.,Id say this is hands down my favorite budgetgaming mouse. Its nice and comfy, works properly, and also has multiple buttons to assign them to various actions, which is not just limited to games, you can assign them to windows actions as well.Have been using this for the last 2 years and I have absolutely no complaints, although my brother thinks that it looks like a beetle ",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31nlfClYn7L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Please contact_us on: [1800-102-2929]|Material housing: ABS Plastic and Material jug: PP Plastic|Material pulp container and pusher: ABS, SAN|Drip stop, compact design, QuickClean technology, smooth and easy to clean, Frequency: 50/60 Hz|Direct serve, QuickClean sieve and can see-through pulp container|Make up to 1.5 litre in one go|Integrated pulp container","Beyond expected,Good,Perfect Juicer  Very User Friendly in usage,User friendly and convenient to use for fresh juice,Excellent Little Juicer! Fast and Easy to Clean. Produces Very Good Quality Juice,Premium juicer,Good however...,Most effective and convinient juicer i Ever had","First of all i wanted to buy one juicer to have juice instantly.. so i reviewed many juice blender and finally i bought this Philips HR1832.. i made carrot..apple... Orange.. promoganate..etc... All i did and had fantastic juice... Fruit pulp and waste all collected in one tray and it is easy to wash.. thanks for this instant juice blender.,Good deal,I find this Juicer amazing endtoend it takes me around 1015mins to extract the juice, clean  pack it back. That easy it is to Use!,The product is very good and user friendly. Exactly as demonstrated in video,I used to have juicer many moons ago but it was a cheap model and never really produced the juice I wanted and I couldnt afford the mega posh ones which juiced fruit and veg to within and inch of its life so I was excited to be able to start using this new one. First off this is a nice compact design. It really doesnt take up much room and it has small suckers on the base to keep it in place on the kitchen surface.The juicer is simple to take apart and put together, instructions are not really needed, though there are some basic pictures provided on the box.The juicer spout where you put your fruit and veg in is quite small. I need to cut up my apples into quarters to fit them in and although this is not a huge flaw it is a shame as you wouldnt need it to be much bigger to get them in. So far my juicing attempts have all been successful  apples, raspberries, grapes, cucumbers, carrots have all yielded a fair amount of great tasting juice. I also unwittingly popped a chopped up mango in there without realizing it is one of the starchy fruits that is apparently doesnt work with  it seemed to work fine for me. I can see how a banana or avocado might not work, but the mango did produce juice so you may want to experiment. The pulp left at the end is still fairly damp and I found I could easily squeeze liquid out but its in no way dripping and I would say a decent job had been done. I know that there is a lot of goodness left in the pulp so if you want to use this then just make sure you clean your fruit before juicing and remove anything you wouldnt want in the pulp. That way once you have finished juicing you can just scoop out the pulpy goodness and do whatever you want with it.Juicers produce different quality juices. There are really 2 key areas to judge a juicer on its juice quality.1 Some juicers produce a higher amount of juice per food item. You can tell by the drier pulp that is extracted.2 Some juicers produce frothier juice and warmer temperature juice  2 signs of lower quality because the air and heat are evidence of the oxidization of nutrients. A faster spinning juicer centrifugal will often produce more heat and froth, which is why the masticating style juicer slower, chewing action creates better quality juice.In terms of these 2 key areas, this Philips does an alright job producing dry pulp and an excellent job with low froth and low temperature juice. The slow masticating action is excellent and on par with other juicers.  To get more descriptive,  I like to run the pulp of the Philips through the juicer 1 time to get extra juice out of it. Running it a 2nd time and I get hardly any juice. One extra run of the pulp is sufficient.The specs for this juicer claim you can clean it in under 1 minute. I think this is a little optimistic but that said its not too far off. All the plastic parts rinse clean easily and quickly with warm water and the only part which takes a little more effort is the metal sieve and grater. This has teeny tiny holes in it to help separate juice and pulp and so it does get clogged up with stuff. That said I have found that using a soapy scourer sponge and gently rubbing with the green side does the trick pretty swiftly. It certainly does not take much elbow grease and I found it very easy to clean off  unlike my previous juicer where you needed to scrub for half an hour and you were still finding bits the next time you used it.I think this is a pretty decent juicer for the everyday user. Yes it could produce a little more liquid from the things it juices but it is certainly not bad and the stuff it produces is on the whole clear from bits. The anti drip spout is not quite antidrip and you do need to watch out for juice on the fruit plunger when you put pieces in as I have whipped it out too quickly and splashed drops of fresh juice all over the place. For the current price I would say it is well worth it.,High quality premium juicer, with low noise and excellent ability to squeeze max 80 to 90 juice out of fruits and veggies. The look and feel is outstanding and way above what other options are available,I have been using this for a month now.It is easy to use, and clean and assemble.But at times, I have seen that the pulp is also coming in the juice and sometimes it makes a different sound while it is grinding.I feel the carrot and beetroot pieces should be cut a bit smaller and not like a slice, cause if i cut like a sliceflat, one carrot slice got stuck within the blades and the machine made a different sound and it was not giving more juice but i could see the pulp.Try to cut the carrot pieces of atleast 12 inch size like a round one and not like a slicebut overall, good experience as i make carrot and beatroot juice and  it takes 1520 minutes to cut, grind and clean.very easy to use and very easy to assemble.Thanks,Perfect home juicer , easy to clean, assemble and comparable i loves it",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31-jt474B1L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Simultaneously I was using the USB ports in the Hub for connectivity of my wireless mouse and one port for external harddisk.  This continuously gave me problems with connectivity of the mouse or the HDD.  I got errors like USB device not detected etc.  Till a point, where it refused to detect my mouse.At home, I used the hub for connecting only to my external HDDs two numbers and it is working fine.  For a moment, I was trying to return the product, but since I got this delivered in Mumbai at my Office and then I had returned home to Karnataka, it refused to process return in a different city.Right now, it is working fine, since I do not need ethernet at home.,Speed is more than wireless,I am not used since it restricted in my system.,I have used it with HP and Dell Laptop. Its compatible with all. Its plug and play and easy to use.,Good product,It works perfectly,A trusted and a reliable brand with a convenient design having a slot for folding the cable. It works and works well every time.However, they made 2 strange design decisions that take some points off the satisfaction of using of the product1 There is a bright white light on the product which keeps flashing when the connection is active. It is a huge annoyance when Im working at night.2 The cable is flat, which is like a doubleedged sword. On one hand, it comes in handy when folding it on itself and redacting into the body. But when its not hidden and used with a laptop, with the adapter being visible, the flat cable folded sideways looks ugly.The product wouldve been a perfect 55 if TP Link didnt make these strange design decisions. Hope this helps. Thanks.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/219039qa+PL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

Overall for the price its worth product. The cushion on the mic comes out easily , couldnt have been fixed properly,Good,The built design is ok for the product. Everytime i wear and do the resizing my hair gets stuck in the band which is irritating. Rest sound and all is good,I stopped using it after continuously using for 3 hrs for office use. It can not be used for long duration calls or back to back meetings. Ears starts paining after 23 hours use. Speaker cover is very thin. I will give this device to someone needy.Sound quality and built quality is nice but comfort is huge issue with this device due its tight overhead band. It keeps both sides on ear for getting better sound or noice cancellation. But the one who is looking for noice cancellation will buy over ear bigger headphones.I use all types of headphones, overear, onear, earbuds. Earlier used Sennheiser onear headphones but it never gives pain.Ideally if anyone buying onear simple headphones then it is for calls or meetings where they still want to hear sound in their room. Some attention to sound in your room, for example keeping an eye on kids while being in meeting. Basic padding or multiple layer soft covers for onear will be helpfull.Guys go for iBall rocker overear or HP overear wired headphones for long duration office calls. It cost less compare to this Logitech device.However this is still good buy for upto 60 mins use for 1 sessioncallmeeting and then a break. Only issue for people having back to back meetings.,Nice quality,I bought this because I had to work from home and had to take calls. My only worry was the noise cancellation because I live next to a busy road. And I am happy with the purchase as the noise cancellation is working great. People on the other side of the call have never complained about any kind of background noise. The plastic quality used is great and its not squeaky. The wire is long enough. The sound output is good enough, but I dont intend to listen any music on these. If you need something for music then this is a wrong product.Con The cushion is not adequate and starts hurting the ear lobes within 5 mins. I had some extra cushions so I added those over the ear piece.,Build quality is not that good but sound quality,noise cancellation is best in the range of less than 1000.,After covid19 our life changes a lot. Online meeting, conferences, webinar, even online classes became new normals. In this situation a good headphone with mic is necessary for doing work flawlessly and this headphone has everything which i needed.1 Audio quality is good and crystal clear without any additional noise2Mic is also very good with good noise cancellation3Thanks to amazon for their service and ontime delivery.

With an overall positive impression of Logitechs performance compared to my experience with similar from Dell, HP  I decided to try the slightly cheaper and compact MK215.While I knew this would be more compact, with fewer keys  I feel I should highlight the disadvantages I can see immediately especially for users of fullsize keyboards at work  refer image1. While my hands will get used to closer keys  they also seem much less springy lower. Overall size is also too small to place on ones lap and type, which I could with the other wireless keyboard, especially during WFH.2. Big point is the MUCH larger size of the dongle. This will need to be removed and stashed carefully at home every time I throw my laptop into my bag for a meeting. I never did this for MK270 and simply kept dongle fixed forever to my laptop USB port. That dongle also had a slot inside the mouse for safekeeping, which is not there in MK215.3. Neither mouse nor keyboard has a switch off  MK270 had switch on both. MK215 mouse takes 2 AA, whereas MK270 takes 1 battery.4. Mouse is shaped different  lower arch and wider  which may simply take adjusting. Feels a little cheaper.While a real review can only be provided much later  seeing how keysclicks perform over the long run and one hopes that Logitech will have taken care of that quality  while I dont have any complaints so far, I feel paying a bit extra for the MK270 may suit many folks out there. Hope the review helps  will update later if I see find any fundamental issues with time.,Product is good but lagging very much.Not enjoying satisfied with this product.Bad  for me.,It is working fine till now.,The keyboard is good but pretty small when compared with regular keyboards. It works well and keys and ok.,Excellent,Go fot it good product, handy.. just connector is little bit big size,Works properly.Initially noticed lag and then looked it up online.It seems USB receiver faces interference when another port next to it is plugged in to other device.I had the lag of both mouse and keyboard actions but noticed that my USB receiver was plugged next to HDMI port which was also connected to a monitor. I switched the USB receiver to another USB port on other side of laptop without any neighboring ports. Dont face lag now.Try to use a USB hub if you dont have a USB port away from existing used ports.,Build quality and all are good but the batteries cap is little bit loose for the keyboard and mouse is totally fine.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31SAqKSRWyL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

It was totally beaten up and inside the batteries of the keyboard ha come loose alsothough I could just pop it back in no problem. Thankfully it works fine, I tested all the keys and they are functional so lets get to the meat of the subject, or paneer if youre vegetarianI think this keyboards performance will vary according to your use case. For me the primary objective was to get an android compatable keybaord since I had shifted the majority of my wokrload from my laptop to my tablet. I checked the internet and settled on this little guy becaue of teh glowing reviews and from my friend who had the ink variant of the keyboard. I bought it along with the Logitech Pebble M350 wireless mouse since it came in a bundle and honestly I dont regret it. Both of them fir very well into my work type and theyve made my life a lot more easier.This is of course a bluetooth keyboard and it does not have any wireless dongles hidden away in the chasseI checked. The keyboard has no backlighting as expected from a wireless eyboard that runs on regular pen torch batteries, and from my friends experience this battery will last you a long time. The major feature of this wireless keyboard over the other brands in teh market is the ability to switch between 3 bluetooth capable devices with the press of a button. Now I personally thought that I wouldnt be using this feature all that much since I was plaaning on using this keyboard for my android tablet. But then I realised that, I could set up my laptop as a second device and switch between my tablet and laptop without any issues making it easier to type out papers on my laptop and responding to texts, emails on my android tablet at the same time. Nowadays I cant stop using this feature since I have my phone, tablet and laptop paired to this keybaord and my productivity has become much more efficent. It is honestly very neat.The keys are rounded which is much more pleasant to type on than lets say square keys, and the slight inclination of the keyboard serves as good angle that reduces finger fatigue while typing. This comes with no wrist rest so people who have had hand injuries should either look for another keyboard or buy the wrist rest seperately. Teh keys are membrane keys and they feel a bit stiff in my honest opinion, but nonetheless it has a good feedback and the typing experience is very comfortable. It does not have a number pad as you migth have seen from the product images, so if you are someone that crunches a lot of numbers ine excel you might want to skip this keyboard.The latency is quite low from my perspective, I dont think they have that crispy Logitech Lightspeed tech built into it though, but you wont be using this for gaming, and if you are planning to then please dont. This keyboard performs horribly in gaming, and I mean its terrible. This is a keybaord targeted at people who do a lot of typing across multiple devices and it is built with portability in mind. If I am ambitious enough I can probably stuff this keyboard into my pocket, because of how small it is. Like my friends say I have small hands, well this keyboard was probably designed for a rat because my hands are huge compared to this keybaord. Sometimes while I am resting my hand on the homerow my ring finger accidentally presses one of teh mushy media buttons at the top and everything I am doing goes into stasis. But that is more of a me problem than a problem with this keyboard. It does come with arrow keys which is very surprising. They actually managed to squeeze it in.I mean thats pretty much it for this keybaord. Dont buy it for Rs.3k I suggest waiting for a discount because this thing is certainly not worth that much. I would say this is like a Rs.1.4K keyboard but thats just my opinion. If you are buying this for the android experience then I suggets buying it bunded with the mouse. Because both of them kind of complete each other. With that being said Im going to conclude my review.,Mouse came turned on. Apart from that no issues discovered till now, it going good.,Its one of the best budget keyboards I have ever used.. the membrane keys are very soft and easy to click not lift off weight  easy on the fingers  its been around 1yr since I bought this keyboard  and Iam using it ever since  no issues so far and Iam highly satisfied with my purchase definitely gonna recommend it . Very good typing experience so far, Caps Lock indicatorHeight isnt adjustableNo backlight,The key travel is very very less, please keep that in mind. Otherwise a decent product at the price range.,I bought this in combination with a Logitech Pebble M350 Bluetooth Mouse for the sole purpose of using it with my iPad. It has made my tasks easier and with recent iPadOS updates, there are tons of shortcuts that make iPad experience more productive. Since I was going for a retrolooking device, I chose Sand color. Makes me nostalgic about the old school computer devices that had similar finish. Connectivity is fast. You just switch it on and its connected to your primary device in a matter of seconds, even less. They keys are not silent but at the same time not loud enough to disturb your environment.You can connect upto 3 devices and switch between them seamlessly with the push of a button. Im also using the setup for gaming. Will maybe update later about that experience.Final Comments Ergonomic, economic, portable and lovely! Recommend buy for all who need to get work done fast.,This Keyboard is awesome , It has a flawless connectivity and a great size for portability . Just that it is not fitted with a lift at the back and I miss the backlight design , but it is a value for money product . Works flawlessly with mac as well as Windows.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41EIVJvXxsL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Now the UPS was made on by power button it is to be pressed and hold for not less than 1 second before release or release after beep tone connected to PC with 32 inch LED TV, initially some repeated chattering without any power interruption to the load was happening, if power input is kept off on battery. It was happening some times.When it is on battery,  beep sound was occurring every 22 sec against APC Manual spec of 60 sec.it withstood for 18 minutes for the PC with 32 inch LED TV on battery. Battery save mode was in off conditionFurther it got switched off within 5 sec of low battery alarm, against 60 sec specified in the manual.The manufacturing date as per slip glued on original packing was Nov, 2018 photo attached but the test and quality passing date is 11.01.2018 12.53 hrs photo attachedAs my load is more than 30w,  I can put it on battery saver mode, the battery saver button to be pressed and hold for not lessthan 2 seconds before release to change the state , this  is minor but the holding time is no where written in the manual.The UPS body temperature appears to be on higher side, when compared to Numeric installed at office under similar ambient temperature while on load with input mains as well as while in off condition without charging but connected to mains.The above is initial experience only, any updates shall be shared in future.Note1 This item isnt eligible for returnFor safety reasons, items containing flammable liquids or gases cant be returned to Amazon. For more information or help, please contact them.If you want return facility search for other alternativesUpdate 1The service person called me on 14.04.19 and informed about his planned visit on 15.04.19.The service person visited in the morning of 15.04.2019 and disassembled the UPS, there was a  minor play with the battery,  the whole casing is of plastic, one side cover opens including top as one part the play may be due to design  manufacturing tolerances. The PCB and the transformer were already firmly fastened to body and all connections were also tight. Hence the looseness is acceptable. The battery manufacturing date was Oct 2018. I agreed for his optional proposal to replace with a new sealed battery but manufactured in Sept 2018. The chattering may be relevant to building wiring, as it is not happening with main sockets in other rooms or if we remove UPS input plug from the same socket see next update for accurate reason .  In the whole,  the service persons only concern was hotter transformer, based on his experience but it will be replaced only if it fails.Prompt response of service center is appreciable that too for an interior of 76 km from service center, located at state capital and it compliments the non return policy.Update 2It is fully charged with replaced battery  and backup time was tested with the same load as above. But this time large improvements were observed in the backup time and  parameters difficult to reason out as below.Backup time is 32 Min until some different  type of blinking of power led   different type of beeps happens for few seconds, may be relevant to battery saver mode  and however it got normalized in auto  after 5 min further,  the battery low blinking of power LED occurred hence total 37 min against 18 min of earlier experience as above and these beeps occurred for 40 seconds before it tripped against 5 seconds of earlier experience as above, but power LED was glowing for every few seconds till further 20 seconds in off condition.Battery on  beep was occurring for every 59.90 seconds 1 min to indicate the load is on battery against every 22 second earlier experience as above. I was totally involved with service person as it has to protect very costly, bulky and  distant service partner type equipment at my home . He has replaced only battery, and he has not even removed the PCB. But how,  so many wonders have happened is yet to be analyzed and reasoned out.Note 2I NonRMSMultimeter does not properly read the voltage of a UPS that uses stepped approximated output sine wave while on battery. Hence  output voltage of a 230 VAC UPS is measured to be between 170180 VAC when on battery.Ii Low voltage cut off will act if any separate low voltage , high voltage cutoff protection is used at outlet of UPS while on batteryIii chattering may take place at UPS if any separate surge protection is used at UPS outletIv some body already advised not to use any surge protection at input to UPSV APC service person informed that APC UPS will not on, if house is not properly grounded earthing is to be proper to protect from surges.Vi if UPS is on battery with battery saver mode enabled  i.e. mains off it will give only 5 min backup to loads less than  30w as no load protection acts,  however if the load is more than 30w , it shutdowns while 5 min juice still left  i.e. if we disable battery saver mode  we will get 5 min more backup powerFrom the above , the UPS is now functioning as per specifications. but one star of APC is reduced against initial issues of equipment, though super fast response exists from their service center , 5 stars to  Ms Appario Retail Private Ltd the seller, 5 stars to the APC service center and 5 stars to courier  Ms Delivery for safe and fast delivery.Update 3 After 4 months of use , backup time testing ignoring erroneous tests in betweenThe ups was made on and battery saver was made off , due to this  the ups started self charging further and I have waited till the charging is completed. Now,  the TV as monitor with PC were made on  it took upto 0.45 amp during cold boot , amp measured with clamp meter while mains is on. once the PC stabilised 0.3A the mains is switched off. Now it gavea  backup of 17 minutes with beep every minute and given repeated beeps at 17th min. Again every min one beep started for 5 min. After this repeated beeps occurred  for 30 second and ups got tripped. Hence I got 22 minutes and 30 seconds in total. In view of this the star rating is retained at 4 star.One more observation is that its transformer temperature is high while it is on battery that means more energy is being wasted by transformer.I got the battery replaced one more time on 15,01.2020 under warranty as backup time reduced to 11min under the same conditions and load. With new battery I am getting 24 minutes. Hence the Apc is being letdown by battery manufacturer where Apc quality person should have control. After warranty I will install battery from exide and see.,ProsThe device is sleek, small and blends into the environment.ConsMakes a lot of noise.I bought this primarily to support my television Sony XR65X90K to handle the switch from generators to mains For  30 Secs. It is not sufficient to do that and the TV switches on and off continuously when running on UPS power. Im not sure what the problem is as the wattage is sufficient.If you have a similar use case as mine, better consult a local inverter shop and get a UPS that fits your requirement. Else, you will end up with dead weight.,Easy to install,My PC has a 550W PSU with 80 Bronze effeciency but installed components are not supposed to go beyond 280watts under max load. This UPS shuts down as soon as my GPU GTX 970 reaches 100.Then I used it for my printer. But as soon as I hit print, the UPS shuts down. So its useless there as well.Now its attached to my TV, router and speakers. Atleast I can watch Netflix uninterrupted.,Im getting trouble in this I think this is not working properly where should I return,Value for money, so far working good.,Small but big life of battery,It is good for electricity stability",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31sSNZUSkfL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Some of the dislikes Ive mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but Im quite used to it and Im loving it..  the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is whyAfter a long gap, I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous highend headphones but unfortunately, he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes I regret it   he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face D. He said Im keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.So the moral of the story is Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.Jokes apart, people, you cant go wrong with this purchase. Its worth every square inch.Happy Shopping...END OF UPDATEI got this product 3 days back, and I got it for Rs. 1299 lightning deal of course This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the productThree days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I cant help the excitement...Likes1 Good built quality  45It is sturdy, for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.2 Sound quality3.55If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard as noticed in other reviews. Bass is deep enough for the price.3 Connectivity pairing is easy connects like a breeze. 454 Dual Mode Wired and wireless Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone.  I couldnt find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though   I absolutely loved this feature. 55Battery backup Im impressed with the battery backup of this beast. Ive been using it for 3 days for 23 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume its true. So far so good. will update it after a months usage.Dislikes1 Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You wont get that ambiance. Boats website saysDont just be loud, be loud and clear, Nope... sorry Ive to disappoint you on this. When its loud its not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.2 Comfort Believe me, its not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 3045 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 11.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...3 Range Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 56 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And Im experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I dont know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if its a problem. 4Flimsy aux cable I cant complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. Remember I paid only 1299 for it. But with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. Mi note 3 had issues, Mi 4 also had issues with aux. Not sure whether its the problem with my device. But it worked flawlessly on my laptop.5 Wafer thin service centers Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you cant find any service centers near you. This is a hit or miss guys...6 Voice cancellation I didnt find this effective. Maybe its just me, not sure.7 Microphone is pretty much useless. You cant make calls with this headset.Some alternatives These are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you1Sennheiser CX 180 Street II  I dont think Boat can beat this ones quality. The sound is incomparable the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired inear headphone. I own 2 of this beauty. Total value for money. If you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then I cant a better alternative than this.2 SoundMagic E10C InEar Headphones with Mic BlackGold This is another TVFM earphone3Sony Extra Bass MDRXB250 OnEar HeadphonesDont buy it1 If you are an audiophile  obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones D 2 If you intend to use it for long hours.Buy it1 If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2 If you require a wired and wireless package in one..Verdict Id give this headphone a score of 3.75 5If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hasslefree Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you wont regret it you wont be disappointed. In this price range, I couldnt find any other headphone with such a performance. We dont have many options.... Do we  P PThe actual price is Rs. 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57 discount. pls dont fall for that. I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.Note Im not an expert in this field. This is just a lay mans review.Thank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decision..,My boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and i wanted a new pair of headphones and i wanted them to be over the head types like this one. I also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since i would be using it for the TV, Laptop and my phone. I have fumbled with this strata of the headphone market previously and after buying good for nothing ones from motorola, i chanced upon this.Value for moneyGood bassNice sound qualityGood build, but not premiumIf you can get it below 1000 rs, then it is a very good deal,its difficult to let go of  my boat headphones , i bought this on 2019 for a 1k price on sale , the bluetooth was working fine but it went off after an year , i know this would happen , and thats when the legendary aux cable comes in , ive been using it with the aux cable for almost 2 years again , but later the top headphone band broke off , i used a fevistick to stick it up , and used it , i stretched it even further but it broke again , but there is no difference in soundquality what so ever so far , its been a soldi 3 years since usage of this product , still trying to stretch it further , if it doesnt work , i may hvae to say good by to this beast of a product , and its sad to note that the current boat products on offer fail to deliver this robust quality , theyve become the company that focuses on quantity over quality nowadays , evolutions aside , i gotta respect this product for what it has given me so far .,I genuinely reviewed after 2 years and its still working but once head strip was broke i fixed it by using YouTube video overall its very good purchase for me.,Dont think about specs you can blindly buy because it worth it,I recently purchased the boAt Rockerz 400 Bluetooth headphones. They have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable. The battery life is also impressive, with up to 8 hours of playback. Overall, Im very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones.,Under 1300 rs it is best head phone.... sound quality super, bass good, noise cancelation not bad, product weight not heavy.,Nice headphone, nhi,bole to jhakasSound quality is very good and bass is also  good but I was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that, hhh laalach karna buri chijh h, hum sudhrenge nhi kabhiI think u r bored sum of this headphone  mast hai enjoying,Good quality, easily connected my lg 4k smart tv",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zejggGzLL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

You cant make calls with this headset.Some alternatives These are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you1Sennheiser CX 180 Street II  I dont think Boat can beat this ones quality. The sound is incomparable the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired inear headphone. I own 2 of this beauty. Total value for money. If you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then I cant a better alternative than this.2 SoundMagic E10C InEar Headphones with Mic BlackGold This is another TVFM earphone3Sony Extra Bass MDRXB250 OnEar HeadphonesDont buy it1 If you are an audiophile  obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones D 2 If you intend to use it for long hours.Buy it1 If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2 If you require a wired and wireless package in one..Verdict Id give this headphone a score of 3.75 5If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hasslefree Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you wont regret it you wont be disappointed. In this price range, I couldnt find any other headphone with such a performance. We dont have many options.... Do we  P PThe actual price is Rs. 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57 discount. pls dont fall for that. I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.Note Im not an expert in this field. This is just a lay mans review.Thank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decision..,My boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and i wanted a new pair of headphones and i wanted them to be over the head types like this one. I also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since i would be using it for the TV, Laptop and my phone. I have fumbled with this strata of the headphone market previously and after buying good for nothing ones from motorola, i chanced upon this.Value for moneyGood bassNice sound qualityGood build, but not premiumIf you can get it below 1000 rs, then it is a very good deal,its difficult to let go of  my boat headphones , i bought this on 2019 for a 1k price on sale , the bluetooth was working fine but it went off after an year , i know this would happen , and thats when the legendary aux cable comes in , ive been using it with the aux cable for almost 2 years again , but later the top headphone band broke off , i used a fevistick to stick it up , and used it , i stretched it even further but it broke again , but there is no difference in soundquality what so ever so far , its been a soldi 3 years since usage of this product , still trying to stretch it further , if it doesnt work , i may hvae to say good by to this beast of a product , and its sad to note that the current boat products on offer fail to deliver this robust quality , theyve become the company that focuses on quantity over quality nowadays , evolutions aside , i gotta respect this product for what it has given me so far .,I genuinely reviewed after 2 years and its still working but once head strip was broke i fixed it by using YouTube video overall its very good purchase for me.,Dont think about specs you can blindly buy because it worth it,I recently purchased the boAt Rockerz 400 Bluetooth headphones. They have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable. The battery life is also impressive, with up to 8 hours of playback. Overall, Im very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones.,Under 1300 rs it is best head phone.... sound quality super, bass good, noise cancelation not bad, product weight not heavy.,Nice headphone, nhi,bole to jhakasSound quality is very good and bass is also  good but I was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that, hhh laalach karna buri chijh h, hum sudhrenge nhi kabhiI think u r bored sum of this headphone  mast hai enjoying,Good quality, easily connected my lg 4k smart tv",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41zejggGzLL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Bought this yesterday, so havent used it much, so an early review. But the most detailed review so please read till the end. Very important points are mentioned.Looks are cute! It looks really nice and elegant. I am using it with a MacBook Air. So far it seems there are no problems using it. The scrolling is smooth, connection does not drop, and there is no lag. Connection is instant. There is no pairing required. Its plug and play along with the dongle provided with it.It sits low on the table, feels weighty but not in a wrong way. The battery adds to its weight, but I have used heavier mice before, and this one feels just right. It has good grip. Nothing to complain about that.Buttons are nice and clicks are satisfactory, not too noisy they are just right. Scroll wheel doesnt feel cheap at all, though I believe it couldve been better quality. Body is matt finish and doesnt leave fingerprints on it, though if youre someone who eats and handles the mouse, then itll show the oil prints and thats true with any peripherals. The mouse doesnt feel cheap overall, but it is definitely plasticky, though not in the bad sense. It is definitely not cheap looks wise.There is an on, off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery which is included when the mouse is not in use. There is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light. So thats a good thing and a definite plus! The overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse, and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it.Now over to a major flaw. The mouse connects only though its own usb dongle which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself, inside the battery door, which I found mighty impressive and not through the laptops bluetooth. Now this means two things 1. You have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go, which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse, then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario. And worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then youre stuck and I dont think you get only the dongle youll have to check that with the seller, and  then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. Now over to  the problem I am facing, which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. I use a MacBook, so it doesnt have USBC inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook. Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. It is very important. It will NOT connect over MacBooks Bluetooth. Otherwise, it works well with the MacBook. The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. Youll have to get used to that thing. It doesnt feel very natural as the trackpad on the MacBook feels because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesnt jump around, at least with my mouse. Also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and I feel it could have been made better. But I guess at the cost, you really cant complain too much.Overall, I think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with its own dongle is a major drawback I feel. If that doesnt bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me.,The quality of power button is very low easily it can break,Nice Product, works as expected as of now no issues,Good,Very smooth, works on almost every surface, paper, table, cloth etc.Theres a bit rattle sound of the plastic which is just above the buttons rightleft clicksIt will not bother most of you, I am a bit Obsessive with these kind of things, So...Personally I opened the mouse and stuck a paper inside the plastic which presses the click button, resulting in no rattle sound. Now mouse only makes sound when you click the buttons, click click clickBattery life of Logitech is known to be very good.,Quality good, dpi good, good accuracy on off switch available, smooth, good deal at reasonable price.,good product on which you can use for long time,This is good mouse, thanks to Amazon for providing this product at reasonable price. Very sharp and correct working mouse.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31y-oJ1XnqL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

The trick to figuring out is how the cable fits your DP port, both sides. This fit in snugly with GTX and I knew this is gonna work. No need to do any voodoo with pulling cables, powering off this and that, to make DP cable work, just works straight out of the box.Strangely, this cable didnt support my Logitech G603 wireless gaming mouse Lightspeed connection.

No concerns regarding the time taken or the print quality. The only markdown for this product is the setup. The user manual is brief and doesnt explain how to setup the printer wirelessly or by usb. We spent a good hour having to look through the online manual and you tube videos to understand how this was configured and through trial and error, we managed to get it all ready.,Easy to install,Good print and enough for home usage but installation is quite tedious.,Budget product. Installation was a headache. Did not know if it was done or not. But wireless printing is working somehow. Gets the job done.,The printer is good for personal use. Its working fine till now. Its easy to use. Print quality is also good. Scanning is easy and its image is fine. Canon Product quality is good to say.,Shipment received in time on 25 th Sept.

Only worried is that the cost of its Ink Cartridges.,Printing photos ar totally not clear,Pros1 The Best  only wifi all in one printer in the range of 5k with ink saver so called.2 Low usage required  low maintenance Thought of buying ink tank but learnt from friends that its suitable for heavy printing and when they didnt use it for a while repairs needed. Hence decided to go for inkjet with low cost maintenance. This doesnt require daily print like ink tanks.3  product is solid built and no issues observed so far. Many long term reviews also confirmed flawless working for years so decided this model.4 Print quality Black is very good but colour is average. Does the job for kids school project purpose.5 Easy setup  Its very easy to setup if you are techy. Setting up WiFi took little bit of time an hour. I hate reading manuals and it was first time with a printer at home.6 WiFi printing via mobile is a breeze with Canon Selphy app. Easy photo editor by canon is also quite useful handy.Cons1 Black is good but Colour is pretty average. Like I said good enough for home students purpose.2 Not happy with cartidges supplied by Canon. They seem to fill only half or less for demo purpose. It gave around 100 pages for black and 1520 pages of color with lowest quality settings where in they claim 250 Black and 100 color. Both cartidges were almost empty and mobile app started showing the same.2 Ink cartidges cost  yield The cost cartridges seems to be increasing when I was purchasing this it was around 500 for black but now its around 600 and I had no faith on the yield based on what I have got with stock cartidges. Its not worth buying cartidges so go for refill.3 We only find CL 57S Which is small.

I have it installed in the bedroom, about 300 sq ft so well within the advertised max room space. While using the purifier the room is kept closed to minimize pollution addition.Build Quality The purifier is sturdy in its built and aesthetically pleasing. It has a large front grill that acts as the air inlet, and an arched back that has a larger grill for filtered air outlet. The arc helps the air to be released vertically upwards and hence does not add to direct cooling for anyone sitting in front. This helps the filters use in winter which is the main season where it is required. The top of the filter has a dark panel with touch sensitive buttons and a decent sized circular LED screen. The 4 buttons are  Power, Night Mode, Fan Speed, and Child Lock.Setup The air purifier is shipped with its parts packed separately. Thus on unboxing the same has to be setup for use. The setup is pretty straightforward. The main filter units front can be released and the individual filters aligned in order on the central space. The installation order of the filter is as followsFirst  HEPA Filter. The same has indication on top to correct installation. You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left CornerSecond  Active Carbon Filter. The same has indication on top to correct installation. You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left CornerThird  Pre Filter. This one actually clips in place and is used to filter out the larger dust  impurities so that it does not clog the other main filters.Thus the filtering order is Pre Filter  Carbon Filter  HEPA filterWorking The air purifier can be set to different modes. One of them being the automatic mode that automates the purifier working thanks to the inbuilt air quality sensor. The pollution level sensed regulates the fan speed accordingly. 4 levels are programmed and are indicated on the small circular LED screen by means of circular rings of different colors  Blue Min, Violet, Pink, Red Max. Red level would put the fan in maximum speed and blue would turn off the filter automatically.If you are not a fan of the automatic mode, you can use the fan speed button to move through the option of different fan speedmodes. They areFan Speed 1  Indicated by 1 on the screenFan Speed 2  Indicated by 2 on the screenFan Speed 3  Indicated by 3 on the ScreenAutomatic Mode  Indicated by A on the ScreenAllergen Mode  This can be only added on top of Automatic Mode. It essentially bumps up the speed a bit on all the different color levels. This is to suit the sensitive people as this improves the air filtration rate.Turbo Mode  Indicated by T on the Screen. This puts the fan in the maximum speed possibleThats pretty much the major functioning of the air purifier. Additionally the filter has an automaticforced night mode. The purifier automatically detects the lighting in the room and once it senses low to no light it automatically goes into night mode. The same can be forced by pressing the night mode button the purifier. What this does is that if the filter is in automatic mode, the fan speed is reduced on all the levels so as to minimize the noise.Summary So as to summarize my review and add my view here, the filter works pretty well for the use case i have. On regular winter pollution days its able to keep the air quality in control, even when working in automatic mode its able to go down from Red levels to Blue. Switching on an off intermittently as per the air quality levels. On drastic pollution days it has a tough time managing the air quality in automatic mode and i have to force it in turbo mode to get the air quality in control. If not too much of an air change is happening in the room throughout the filter is able to get the air quality to a much acceptable levels.The air quality indicator is a great value add on to the product. Much that is missing in similar priced competitors.I am little disappointed in the night mode working as it compensates air quality over noise. I believe the purifiers task is to ensure that the air quality in room is as good as possible. By reducing the fan speed to reduce noise works ok on normal pollution days, but is totally useless in any thing even a little worse when i dont want to use turbo mode just yetDurability of the filters has been decent. I have used it all through the winters last year and intermittently the summer this year but am yet to get an indication to change the HEPA or the Carbon Filter. On yes that reminds me the Air purifier would automatically sense and indicate when a filter needs to be replaced by displaying an error code on the screen. It even does that for the prefilter which does not have to be replaced but just cleanedwashed. That i have received 34 times this past year.Overall i still strongly recommend this product Good performance with a decent price which has been slashed a good amount from when it launched.,Good product,The product does not stand out notably, but it probably does the work it is supposed to. It is too late now to return this product and try another make.,Over all good product.bEasy to install,Well designed product. Yet, to experience filter replacement and, consequently, the recurring cost.,The product is working nicely and worth buying product.,Writing after almost 1.5 years all pros n cons Everything is good only problem is i live in delhi and hepa filter will cost you around 2000 and it took only 68 months it become totally black few advice1. Dont run it near kitchen it will catch all carbon n pores will b blocked.2. If you live in delhi check it after every month clean with vaccume cleaners.3. Seal your doors most dirt  mosquito come from there open windows only that too seal them and put anti dust and mosquito net on them.4. Run it all day as when u turn it iff after 1 hour your room will be as dirty as ut was.5. You can clean pre filter only dont clean carbon and hepa filter.6. Being and indian if your hepa filter become black get some jot water put some detergent and dip it inside all dust and carbon will come out and use it again haha its paper but its so hard you can wash it 45 times keep it under sun light for 45 hours.7. Sometimes u get error of FO clean all three filter with vaccume or brush careful while cleaning with brush that dust is dangerous can cause problems so wear mask after cleaning hold ur finger on child lock to reset and it will start working8. Bhai delhi m pollution bhot h so family k lie monthly 300rs padta h filter mother wife bachy pura din gher p rhty h so its a must buy to protect them.9. Update fan speed got slow down10. Power consumption on 1st 23 watt, 2nd 33 watt, 3rd 40 watt, max 50 watt best is keep it on automatic mode when room will be clean power consumption will reduced to 23watt and whole night it work in power efficient mode11.

Review is based on testing done the same daySummaryThe product is genuine and sturdy, but the performance is just about average, based on a random file copy performance to fill the entire space.Pros  Cons comparing with SanDisk Cruiser Blade 32 GB Pros1. Solid body, looks and feels great.2. Read speed is fine 22 MBs.3. Product is genuine, covered under 2 Year manufacturer warranty.Cons 1. Fits too tight in usb port, thus causing more wear to the port and may even damage it if not used carefully.2. Capacity is 31 GB precisely 31042043904 bytes, not 32 as advertised. In windows itll show up as a 28.9 GB drive compared to 29.8 in Sandisk. No big deal, just a technical observation.3. Write speed 3.3 MBs is not bad, but slightly inferior to its close competitor Sandisk cruiser blade which easily gives 4 to 4.4 MBs for the same test.4. Warranty is only 2 years, compared to 5 years on Sandisk. But since almost nobody claims warranty after 2 years, and besides the plastic body of Sandisk gets physically damaged in 2 years anyway, so its okay for me.BottomlineIts good enough for casual users, maybe chosen over Sandisk for its look, feel and sturdiness. Frequent users may want to look for better options with easier port fitting and better write speed.DetailsThe product name is HP v236w as shown on its packing the images in listing are correct while its part number is FD236W32, so slightly confusing but both are the same thing.Testing whether it is genuine or fakeThe bottom of the hologram sticker on the packing has a silver layer with scratch and check written on it. Scratching it reveals a 20digit code beneath it, and the right edge of the sticker has the url  to verify this code. Go to support  product authentication page on that url. That page contains instructions and explanation of the results that you may get. Mine were originals, with the codes tested for the first time repeat test result will be a warning that the code was tested before.So that means it is covered under 2 year manufacturer warranty, as declared by hp for Aisa Pacific region.Design and build quality  Sturdy, stylish but with a design flawIt is exactly as shown in the picture. The body is a solid steel case with open front and the back sealed with a black plastic cap. The plastic back fits perfectly and gives it a stylish look, though it may come off later. The HP logo, product code etc are embossed on the steel body so likely wont be erased with time. Overall, it looks and feels great. The flaw I noticed was that it takes significantly more strength to push it into the usb port, compared to other usb devices like generic usb cables or usual plastic pendrives like Sandisk. You almost have to fight with it to push it in or pull it out. This means its frequent use can wear out the usb port too soon, or may even break it if not used carefully.Capacity  31 GB, not 32, will appear as 28.9 GB in windowsIt is advertised as a 32 GB drive but the actual capacity is 31GB, and yes, Im fully aware of the decimal vs binary calculation difference, Im a hardcore linux user. To be precise, its exact capacity is 31042043904 bytes on both pendrives I tested. So in windows it will show up as a 28.9 GB drive. In linux it will show up as either 31 GB, or 28.9 GiB binary calculation like windows. For comparison, my 32GB Sandisk shows up as 32010928128 bytes, or 32 GB, or 29.8 GiB. This loss of 1 GB in a 32GB pendrive is no big deal for me, just a technical observation.PerformanceRead speed about 2022 MBsWrite speed about 3.3 MBsTested with  a collection of ISO files ranging from about 350MB to 4GB, along with a few smaller files like pdf or txt. Total size of the collection was about 30.2 GB 28.2 GiB.I did this testing on linux, so to be fair, the write performance may be slightly better on windows as it works better with fat32 that the pendrive comes formatted as.Edit No performance difference on Windows either. Formatted as exFAT on windows 10 to make it multiboot with YUMI. Readwrite speeds were same while copying ISO files to it, or reading them to load in memdisk while booting.I could do more accurate testing with tools like dd command but didnt bother as the difference usually isnt very significant.,Ups.....The product is very good, i mistakenly washed it 8n washing machine with my pants but it is still running like new. No data loss problem or data corrupt problems i have faced yet.Downs......The only downside is this pendrive is little slow because of technology 2.03.2 is newer oneAnd second one is not affact your data at all.. the silver paint on pendrive is vanishing time by time and it is now turning black,Product is good but slow,Storage is good but doesnt work for car stereo,57 GB OUT OF 64,So far so good,Good product,Ok",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31febYa30qL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Normally, there is always a hysteresis in the thermostat dial  it turns on at one point and turns off a little further back. But this one was turning On and OFF at exactly the same point. Then i started observing that if the thermostat was on , it simply remained on. If it was off, it remained off. Tried it multiple times and realised that the thermostat doesnt work.

The information provided below is as per the manufacturer. Boat BassHeads 225 have a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz. It Features 10 mm drivers. Rated Impedance of 16 ohms. Comes with 1.2 meter Flat Tangle Free Cable. 3.5 mm GoldPlated LShaped Audio Jack 90 degrees. Sensitivity  98 dB3 dB.Built Quality  DesignI was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise, Boat BassHeads 225 are fully made up of metal. It has a diagonal gridlike texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch. The metal construction gives Boat BassHeads 225 a premium feel  attractive appearance. The cable used by Boat on BassHeads 225 is Flat with rubberized coating, it is a tanglefree cable  does its job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling. Despite the metal construction, Boat BassHeads 225 are very lightweight  comes with a microphone  LShaped 3.5 mm audio jack which is again made up of metal. Overall the built quality is excellent for the price  seems very durable. The ear buds have proper L  R labels and are clearly visible. Boat BassHeads 225 comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed outofthebox.Audio QualityTo ensure that I can test the BassHeads 225 at their uppermost limit, I used highquality MP3 files of 320 kbps  Lossless audio formats like FLAC  WAV. For smartphone listening, I used Poweramp music player  tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability. For the computer, I used iTunes player  VLC Audio player. I also tested these earphones on Apple iPod, iPhone  Sony MP3 Player. All this went for more than 10 days  finally, I had my results.Boat BassHeads 225 promised what they claimed, they really are very bassy as compared to others. During my tests with them, I found that the audio quality is very good for the price, the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default, by tweaking the equalizer settings a bit, I saw a good level of improvement in the vocals, they were clearer than before but overall average. The treble was again very good, the highfrequency sounds were clear  pleasant to ears. The mids were average but overall the audio experience on Boat BassHeads 225 was decent. When listening to music, the overall sound quality is amazing, you can easily distinguish between different instruments  sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphones.Noise Isolation  ComfortWhen it comes to Noise Isolation, Boat BassHeads 225 are very good at it, They come with medium sized ear tip preinstalled which seemed perfect for my ears, once the earphones are on, I wasnt able to hear outside noise, they sealed my ears completely  delivered an immersive experience. Make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation  comfort. Overall Boat BassHeads 225 are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff  somewhat awkward when used for longer periods. Since the housing is made up of metal, you may find them popping out every now  then when used during running, jogging or any other sport or physical activity, this didnt happen as often for me but for a friend, they keep popping out every now  then while running maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it, An easy solution to this will be using the Ear Hooks which came along with it. When using BassHeads 225 with Ear Hooks, they were a bit uncomfortable initially, but as I got used to them, they were fine, plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on them.Flat Cable  MicrophoneThe cable is great, I personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free  comes with a rubberized coating. The cable does its job well. The microphone is again exceptionally good, it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise. During calls, the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance. There is one button on the microphone which helps to pick upreject calls on the go, without taking your phone out. It can also be used to control music, which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like Boat BassHeads 225.Warranty  PriceBoat BassHeads 225 comes with standard One Year Warranty, so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe, in case you need it for warranty.Final Thoughts!Ive personally used Boat BassHeads 225 InEar Headphones for more than two weeks average daily two hours of listening before writing this review and Im pretty much impressed with them. Im personally a fan of Extra Bass IEMs and currently, my primary IEM is Sony MDRXB50AP which again falls under Extra Bass category. Comparing Sony MDRXB50AP with Boat BassHeads 225 will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them, but I would still like to add that BassHeads 225 did a great job and didnt disappoint me, obviously it doesnt stand a chance in front of Sony MDRXB50AP but still looking at the price of BassHeads 225  the quality they offer, I was really very impressed.Boat BassHeads 225 turned out to be exceptional earphones, after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices  music players, I can say that theyre amazing for the price, a pure steal deal. The bass output is amazing and is very intense, Ill recommend using correct size ear tips  good quality music player like Poweramp Android for better bass output. The treble is good  vocals are average, somewhere I feel that bass overpowers the vocals, but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results. The mids are again average.My Rating  4 out of 5The VerdictTaking everything into account, overall Im very impressed with Boat BassHeads 225. The Built quality is amazing, the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass  good overall soundstage. Tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals, mids  highs. Overall the vocal  highs are good  mids are average but still good for the price. Ill recommend these IEMs to bass lovers  budgetconscious people who are looking for high quality  durable earphones at a reasonable price. Genres like EDM, Rock, HipHop sound really great on them. Boat BassHeads 225 justify the price they come for, the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price range.HOPE I HELPED YOU.THANKS,Yes, so you have heard that this is the best wired earphone under 500. Yes you can consider it to buy. But there are few points to remember before buy. From my user experience I can tell you this1. This is not comfortable at all. It slips from ear mostly. You feel pain in ear after using it.2. Never buy this for ONLINE CLASS, as it is not possible to wear it 68 hours straightly.3. After switching from Boat Basshead 172, I feel that the bass is not good as the previous one. I dont know why. It should be better.4. Sound dont explode or go outside of the buds to 50 as it go outside on Boat 510 headphone, so its good.5. Feeling heavier on ears. Not as comfortable as Realme Buds 2. Though both are metal build. For balance sound you can buy Realme Buds 2.6. Buy it only to listen music, not for too long time. Do not consider it for Online class and Long time wear session.  Hope it helped you. Its just my opinion from using Boat 225, Boat 172, Boat 510, Realme buds 2, Mi basic.,Its a very good product but i dont recommend buying this because earpiece is heavy and you need to keep adjusting it and pushing it inside whenever you move your head, they will fall off easily with the slightest motion, you will soon find it annoying. Sound quality, build quality everything is good but earphones falling off ears will irritate you.,Raat me apne Babu se dhere dherebaat krne pr v aacha se sunae deta h,I purchased the product a year ago.It worked fine.I love the sound quality.but you may not expect it to work after a year.My headphone doesnt work  now properly .My warranty get expired so ,I have to buy a new one.,Good buy but 1 side earphone stopped after 67 month,Sound quality is above average .. but I got 1.5 years old manufactured ear phones.. build quality is as per cost . cant expect much .. there is buzzzzz sound when music is silent..,The earphones sound is awesome",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/3101FmUqUOL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Room was closed.I retirmed it. Bought BlackDecker 11 fin which is too fast and surpass this bajaj 13fin.,Bajaj name in itself a guarantee of excellence. A very product. Heats up the house in no time. Like a boon to elderly people like us,This is my review after 3 days of usage. Firstly I feel I got a used product as the packing was already unpacked inside the box and normally with a brand new unused oil heater, on first usage you get a smell as the oil and fins heat up for first time. This did not happen for me. Anyways I just thought to see if all is good and hope it performs.The heater has very very slow heating. You need to run it at max thermostat and with full load 2500 or 2900 W and even then it will take very long to feel the warmth. I was able to touch the fins for a second even after operating it for more than an hour without cutting off. Thermostat cut off works but quite below max and then it wont heat up as it gets cut off and on.For such type of heater the room should have just one entry and that should not keep opening often. If you have doors opening every now and then, it will not keep room warm.Over all for the price it has I didnt feel like its worth to operate it when it has so slow heating.,This clearly is one of the best oil heater out there at a very good price. In offline i was getting 13 fin model for 12k to 13k, but here at Amazon i got it at Rs. 9799. This is very silent and heats up the room in 20 to 30 min.,Really worth for the money spent. Easy to use and can be moved to other rooms without any difficulty. The performance is good.,The product is good but the desired product was not delivered,I am happy with my decision to buy this heater. Room gets warm and comfy .,The radiator works very well even in the cold Kullu weather. Has 2 heat settings and when youve turned it on for a while, you can turn the heat settings off and the fan will still blow warm air. Very effective and doesnt give you headache like the rod heaters do. Has auto cutoff as well.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41PhEVR4X4L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

As of February 2015, it is the thirdlargest manufacturer of flash memory.SanDisk was founded in 1988 by Eli Harari, Sanjay Mehrotra and Jack Yuan with Sanjay mehrotra being the president  the CEO.On May 12, 2016, SanDisk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer Western Digital in a US19 billion deal.WHY A DUAL DRIVE, WHY 64 GB  WHY SANDISKxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxBefore we proceed with the musclemerits or the key features of the device, lets have a quick look upon my personal selection process.Dual Drive  Apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage, I chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over. I could have gone with a basic pendrive with a USB to OTG adaptor cable but then I realized, in todays comfortseeking world, whos will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it ,then fit it ,in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement.64 GB  This capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage, price  future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size.64 GB ensures that you wont have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basis.Sandisk  In the recent few years, Sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization, quality and brand image  offers the best value for money deals for an average usage.Moreover, could not find much, reputed brands in the Storage with OTG feature.A Note  Speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version  should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend, Samsung.ABOUT OUR PRODUCTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The device comes with the title SanDisk Ultra  Dual Drive m3.0 and is the newer 2017 version of its previous iteration. Here I need to quote that the term Ultra came quite as a surprise to me as I found nothing in lines with a common understanding of Ultra. We will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed. With a microUSB connector on one end and a USB 3.0 connector on the other, the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones, tablets with micro USB ports only or laptops.Both the connectors are carved out of metal  the USB 3.0 connector is backwardcompatible with USB 2.0 ports. SIZE  The size of the USB is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplaced.The USB fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and 1.5inches when expanded at USB end. CONSTRUCTION The device has a plastic body  the overall construction of the drive is just average. The retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it. However the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and wont give up so easily. Both the USB ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief. FIT  FINISH Being equipped with a retractable mechanism  being too small, the drive is not so smooth to use  slidein or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the OTG drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving size.The USB ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy. STORAGE FORMAT Since the previous FAT32 version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of 4 GB for a single file  NTFS was not compatible with mac OS so with increasing file sizes ex FAT format was devised which doesnt have a size limitation like FAT yet is compatible with Mac as well. So our drive has only ex FAT  NTFS formats to choose  comes in ex FAT by default with 128 KB file allocation size. Increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds a little but will affect the storage capacity little too. Changing it from 128 to 256 KB increased my write speeds from 13 MBs to 15 MBs if thats a relief to anyone.The format would surely work well with most of the TVs, tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to NTFS if it doesnt work. SPEED   The demerit detail    I have been a flagship gadgets freak all my life  Preliminary to my purchase I had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then I did not have speed in my mind as a primary motive for this  there were not many options for dual OTG device, So I took a leap of faith and went ahead with purchase.My basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my TV or mobile, However when I was transferring 6 movies of a total size 8.1 GB , it started showing 15 minutes which kept on getting higher  it felt like waiting forever for it to happen.Even for a single movie of 1.8 GB it took 2 minutes 30 sec by stopwatch to transfer. The write speeds started with 13 MBsec and went down  down to 1011 MBsec. Even with my older Kingston DT elite 3.0 16GB,the write speeds were in excess of 21 MBSec.I admit I have a USB 2.0 port at my laptop yet I was never used to such low speeds ever. The tagline Ultra and mentioned speeds of 130 MBsec which I suppose is the rated max. speeds at USB 3.0 ports felt like a dream and beyond exaggeration.Finally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying. Even in NTFS format speeds were the same.I had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of 2018, thus finally I decided to return it but I suppose I will only get a replacement  not reversal.I know that readwrite speeds depend upon a lot of factors including transferred file type, format configuration of drive, configuration of host  destination device etc.Benchmark Crystal Disk mark scores for a file transfer of 500 MB size were 34 MBs Read  19 MBs  write which looked like a mere consolation. Transfer between my Samsung S7 mobile  S2 tablet too was not fast.Verdict  Yes my friends , all other reviews about this being slow to the point of being unbearable are absolutely right and maybe San disk should retag it as Ultraslow. STORAGE  Out of the total name plate rating of 64 GB , the actual allocated space for usage is around 57 GB which is ok enough. WARRANTY  The product comes with a 5 year limited warranty which is one of the segment best offers. PRICE  I bought the device for 1530 bucks which was reasonable to me given the storage size, Dual drive  brand image. MRP over the pack was printed 2190 bucks  it was tagged made in Malaysia. Only if, it was a bit faster.FINAL VERDICTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all, in my personal opinion given the brand image, Ultratagline  modern day technology advancements, even if you try to be too generous or lenient upon the transfer speeds yet its hard to spare such a low Read Write rates.Even for routine tasks it will keep on reminding you of the compromise you made for a full price. It could have been a great allrounder device coupled with the good brand reputation of Sandisk  5 years of warranty, had its speed been any better.,COVERED HERE Actual storage space, Heating, Mobile Phones, Tight Fitting on mobile phones, Speed, Formatting File System, Value for Money, Free App, Company, Brand, Seller.About Company, Product  Seller1. SanDisk Ultra is a brand of Western Digital which is the same company that sells external harddisk storage devices under the brand WD Elements and WD Portable.2. About 3 to 5 years ago, WD Elements  Portable drives of 2TB and 4TB were priced Rs. 1200 less than current day prices. They were sold by Cloudtail Seller on Amazon.3. Now SanDisk and WD drives are sold by Appario Retail Seller on Amazon.4. For best prices on SanDisk and WD products in India, the current seller has the lowest prices for authentic brand new products.5. Reason for higher prices for same brands same capacity storage devices may be various  such as import duties, taxes, manufacturing costs, higher demand for the brand, etc.REVIEW SanDisk Ultra Dual 64GB USB 3.0 OTG Pen Drive Gold1. STORAGE SPACE Just as in external harddisk drives, the actual usable storage space will be less than what is mentioned on the product.2. SAME AS OTHERS For the 64GB pen drive, actual storage space available is 57.2GB. This is normal and not some fraud or fake advertisement. This is because it has FAT32 File System. Also, the device uses some space for its functionality and use. In Linux OS laptop the available storage space on this FAT32 pen drive is shown to be 61.5GB. So thats 4GB more than what Windows OS calculates using their NTFS File System.3. HEATING Even with just 10 minutes of use, you can touch and feel that the metal part of the pen drive is getting heated. But the performance of the drive has not got affected by the heat. This heating does not happen in WD external harddisks and seems to be unique to small pen drives of various brands.4. MOBILE PHONES The pen drive works with Android OS of Mi phones such as Redmi Note running Android including old Android Version 9 as well.5. TOO TIGHT FOR PHONES The pen drive is a tight fit on mobile phones  tablets  so be careful when pulling it out so as to not damage your phone  because this is also the charging point for your phone. If you feel that your phone is too tight for this pen drive, then it is best not to use it for phone data storage management.6. VALUE FOR MONEY Even if you dont use this pen drive for mobile phone  it is still the best price for a 64 GB pen drive with a USB 3.0 backward compatible with older USB ports on older laptops and computers.7. SPEED The Speed is extremely good for Windows OS laptop, Linux OS laptop and Android Mobile Phones.8. FILE SYSTEM FORMATTING THE PEN DRIVE Unless you are sure you wont use your pen drive on a particular device, dont format the pen drive to change its FAT32 File System.But For Example, If you have decided that you wont use it on mobile phones or tablets because the fitting is too tight and you dont want to risk damage to this point which is primarily used for charging  then go ahead and format the pen drive for your laptop. With NTFS formatting you will see an increase in available storage space in your pen drive. With your Linux systems file format, you will have better storage space than any Windows File System. BEWARE that if the pen drive has NTFS File System then it wont work with mobile phones, tablets, laptops which dont have Windows Operating System. Same way, if you format the pen drive for Linux OS File System, it wont be recognised on Windows laptops, Android phones, tablets, etc. if like most people you will be using this pen drive on laptops or other devices of friends or coworkers, then leave the existing FAT32 File System as it is.9. FREE APP Memory Zone App for Android is bundled free in this pen drive. It is easy to install and doesnt take any Phone Permissions other than Storage Access. It is very useful App with easy userinterface. App takes 64MB storage space on Android Phones. Features include cleaning Junk Files that you may not otherwise know through your phones File Manager App. Enable or Disable Automatic Backup to your pen drive. Add Cloud Storage such as Google Drive or Microsoft One Drive and Add MicroSD card storage to manage all your files from just one Memory Zone App. Restore Backup. Copy, Move, Delete, files as well as clean up WhatsApp related files. See available storage space on your phone. See data sorted into photos, videos, music, documents.10.

It is not a gimmick but an actual working machine. it gives new life to the winter clothes which were of no use due to heavy lint all around. Using this small machine you can remove lint and see the difference. I used it on 23 clothes and am very happy with the result. Let me describe the pros and consPros1. Very easy to use2. Removes any kind of lint3. it also removes lint that is not visible i.e. of the same color which gives rough look to the cloth making it look older. so your clothes look a bit like the new ones.4. lint is collected in a container that is easy to cleanCons1. The process is very very slow. you need to move the machine on the cloth surface a number of times.2. the build quality is plasticky like cheap toys. it may break if fallen on a hard surface.3. the cable length is very small. The plug comes off the socket easily. you need to sit very close to the socket making it a bit difficult to use sometimes.4. the lint collector comes off very often5. the rotor blades make a weird noise as if they are going to break.6. the BIGGEST PROBLEM is that you need to sit for prolonged periods to make your clothes lintfree which strains your neck badly and if you are suffering from cervical then forget it. you will use it once and will never touch it again. however, you can make an arrangement to hang the clothes on a wall hanger and remove lint by keeping your neck straight.other than that it is a good product and can be tried.Thanks,product is good overall, working fine but the seller should pack it more carefully as i received the upper detachable part in a broken condition as it is  non replaceable makes it more difficult for the customer,but coming to the working part the product quality is good, wotks fina and removes everything easily.a must buy product for winter.,I have used a similar product earlier but this one works better and size is also very effective, using is very ergonomic and like I said, does the job well. Come with a small brush to bruah off samll residue on the fabric. Would recommend buying this. Delivery and packaging was good too.,Easy to clean easy to use. Does the job. Received the product fast and in perfect condition. There is a leaflet inside promising 6month warranty. If it provides that its teh perfect product for this price.,This is very product it cleans all lint from my woolen clothes but it have 1dislike store area is very less and slim it have problem for cleaning store area and the product is very good,This is very good. Life save in winters to remove lint from your costly winter wear. I have used it on some heavy lint area in my inner wear and its really removed the lints and now I can wear my inner again.,product is so satisfying and easy to use that a child can remove lint from his clothes. product overall is satisfying expect the the compartment where lint get consolidated it gets loose in every movement,Product is good and solve the lint problem very effectively so go for it",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/51MWh9t3Z2L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isnt an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics  Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers  hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members  are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined  immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT  REQUIREMENT vs ACTUALxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger  was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements1. DATA EXCHANGESince it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didnt bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2. LENGTH OF THE CABLE Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short  simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plugin any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passengers seat.3. TANGLE FREE FLEXIBILITY STRENGTH STANDARDSI am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness  a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due its cable size  flexibility is almost tanglefree.The associated cable was not exactly thick but cant be termed as thin or delicate too. Its not the thickest Ive seen but then thickest doesnt always means most durable. Given my application its more than just suitable.The overall built  quality of the cable  insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa  an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4. COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORSHad an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT  There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A  micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Goldplated is more of a misleading  fancy termin this case as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance  nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5. AVAILABILITY OF TIESVELCRO STRAPS As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice addon to properly adjust  arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6. DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITYOn the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT  The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging   thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10  without the cable getting hot.7. WARRANTYComes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONSApart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are8. The cable is manufactured in China  imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name  philosophy of amazonbasics.9. The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017  it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10. The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11. A customer care toll free number  email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received  been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesnt also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however its mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice  Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31iESA2h2gL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Exchanged the product and received a piece which had scratches on it the lid of the big jar, the body of the big jar, the blender lid doesnt seem to quite be leakproof... Because of my first experience with wonderchef product, i definitely had high expectations about the quality, and I would say that it did not fulfill my expectations. I had bought it for dhanteras and the exchange and all delayed the plan, also was a lot disappointing for me. Now I am anxious to even use the exchanged one, already the scratches have put me off.,It is very easy to clean .,,there is no switch ,Its very difficult to use without switch in the mixi,Easy to use, easy to clean, space saver, handy,I used this product for making puree.Totally waste of purchase.One jar not working.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51i84+E-LgL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements1. DATA EXCHANGESince it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didnt bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2. LENGTH OF THE CABLE Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short  simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plugin any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passengers seat.3. TANGLE FREE FLEXIBILITY STRENGTH STANDARDSI am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness  a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due its cable size  flexibility is almost tanglefree.The associated cable was not exactly thick but cant be termed as thin or delicate too. Its not the thickest Ive seen but then thickest doesnt always means most durable. Given my application its more than just suitable.The overall built  quality of the cable  insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa  an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4. COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORSHad an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT  There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A  micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Goldplated is more of a misleading  fancy termin this case as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance  nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5. AVAILABILITY OF TIESVELCRO STRAPS As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice addon to properly adjust  arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6. DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITYOn the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT  The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging   thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10  without the cable getting hot.7. WARRANTYComes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONSApart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are8.

Philips PowerPro FC935201 Compact Bagless Vacuum Cleaner ,"Powercyclone 5 technology separates dust from air, Action radius: 9 m, Cord length: 6m|1900W motor for strong suction power, Sound power level: 82 dB, Airflow (max): 37 l/s, Dimensions of product (LxWxH): 410 x 281 x 247mm|Suction power (max):370W ,Input power (IEC): 1900W , Vacuum (max) :33kPa. Weight of product: 4.5 kg|Turbo Brush removes 25 percent more hairs and dust , Multiclean nozzle for thorough floor cleaning|Advanced dust container design for hygienic emptying|Activelock couplings easily adjust to every task|Soft brush integrated into handle, always ready to use","Hassle free bagless vacuum cleaner  No more of maintainingcleaningreplacing bags,Nice little vacuum cleaner but with a couple of drawbacks.,Simple and Effective,A,On the heavier side but satisfied with the product,Good quality, heavy noise,Great Product!,Awesome Cleaning Machine","Once you start using a bagless vacuum cleaner, you will never turn back using it on a weekly basis since Nov 2021, so its a long tern review. Coming from another vacuum cleaner that had bags, this one is truly a hasslefree cleaner, at least you are away from the hassle of maintainingcleaningreplacing bags which is truly a mess, and you would understand only if you have used cleaners with bags. Further, devices with bags tend to get chocked now and then, leading to less suction. INSIDE BOX1. Vacuum cleaner unit2. Flexible pipe with integrated retraceable brush and suction adjustment knob3. Turbo brush nozzle4. Multiclean nozzle5. High suction flat inlet nozzle6. Telescopic extension pipe7. User manual8. Warranty cardThe power cord is 6mtr and device comes with a mechanish to retrace it back into the machine. It has normal 16 amp 2 pin top which can easily fit in 3 or 5pin sockets both 56 amp or 1516amp, but better to connect it to 1516 amp ones only considering its power consumption. OBSERVATIONS  PROS1. Device has high suction power and can be cleaned easily with a bagless design where dust collects in a chamber, and you can empty it in the dustbinno hassles of cleaning and replacing bags.2. Components are high quality, such as the telescopic extension is metallic, though its also a con for this attachment. Even plastic components are of good quality.3. Device easily moves around owing to its big and smooth wheels. You dont need to pull it by force.4. Default flexible pipe itself is long and has an integrated brush that can also be retracted. Its a highly useful attachment considering its attached to a primary flexible pipe and is easily available for use.5. Each attachment here is multipurpose. When you open the package, you feel like very few attachments are provided, but when you start exploring, you discover that all attachments are multipurpose. details below6. Attachments are easy snap fit and remove ActiveLock in the companys terminology. Once you insert the attachments, it click locks and can be removed by a press of a button or release lever.7. Both the turbo brush and multinozzle have flexible neck and wheels on the bottom for easy movement and effective cleaning8. Dust collector can be opened with one press and has removable filters attached to it. These filters can be washed once in a while to prevent clogging.9. the Main unit has H13 filter system to filter fine dust, dust mites, etc., and is equivalent to HEPA 13, as per the company. This filter is accessible from the backside for cleaning purposes.10. Device obviously makes sound but is not in the range of causing irritation to the ears. Its in the bearable range. OBSERVATIONS  CONS1. Telescopic extension is metallic and heavy. So, its a bit of trouble to use for longer durations, especially when you are trying to clean ceilings.2. Reduction of suction power is via a bypass valve built into the flexible pipe and has no way to reduce the power of the machine to reduce suction. So effectively, this valve makes cleaner suck in air from in between to reduce suction at the end, but then consumes the same amount of power. If there had been a control mechanism to reduce power, it would also save electricity.3. Device comes with a 16amp top but its 2pin, so if you are going to use it with modular power sockets with self closing mechanism for holes, it will be a trouble to plug it in everytime.4. I miss the blower system in this cleaner, which is handy at times was there in my previous cleaner. They could have easily implemented it.For the cons reducing 1 star, but its definitely a 4star device. Attachments Flexbile pipe comes with an integrated brush, and you can easily retract it back onto the pipe Multipurpose nozzle has a button to increase its suction power, and with one press, it goes nearer to the floor Turbo brush nozzle sweeps the floor or mattress with rotating bristles along the length, and if you want to turn off the rotation of the brush, there is a button to lock it Main unit has a system on the back and botton side to attach the multiclean and turbo brush nozzle primarily for easy sweep or for storage purposes FINAL VERDICTThis bagless vacuum cleaner is a hasslefree device and requires very less maintenance but it comes at a cost, and if you are willing to stretch your budget, its definitely worth it. I have had no any issues so far in the past 1 year, when using it regularly.,This is a nice bag less vaccum cleaner with a rotating brush that does a great job of cleaning. It also comes with good set of accessories. I found it also cheaper to order it online compared to the Croma store. Two drawbacks not a deal breaker I found and I hope Philips addresses them were,1. It comes with a two pin 15 ampere plug and you need to buy an adapter to use with normal 5 ampere plugs in the house. I was afraid to use the adapter thinking that it may heat with the use but had no issues with heating of the adapter or the plugs in the wall during 1520 minutes of cleaning each room in the house. I do not see a point in having that plug.2. During the use one just pulls it along but It has no handle to lift the machine. I believe that one can use the handle of the dust canister to lift the machine but I am afraid that repeated lifting like this will break the clickon mechanism so ended up lifting the machine as a whole all the time while moving the machine without the hose.As I mentioned earlier these are not deal breaker but enough to take one star off and can have the star back if Philips addresses the issues on this great little machine.,Suction power is good suitable for cleaning carpet , window curtains ,floors and carpets.Cleaning the dust container is also very easy. Only concern i have is, if some length power cord is not pulled out from machine, the power wire that still reamins inside the machine is getting heat from suction motor, after using the machine for nearly 1 hour and i pulled out the cord that was in the machine, it was actually liitle hot to touch not sure is it safe for the live power cord to warm up like this. would have been even better, if this had blower functionality also.,Good product,Cord length and Suction power is satisfactory,Good quality, heavy noise,This is the first vacuum cleaner purchase for me and I can say that I am a happy customer. I bought this back in August 22 and it is serving me well. It comes with attachments that are convenient and reach high places, it has three modes of cleaning tiled floors, carpets and sofas and with pets in the house it has made my life that much easier. Thank you Phillips for a good product and thank you Amazon for a smooth transaction.,Wellbuilt, topnotch quality, suction power is too high.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xQDop2T5L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Headquartered in Delaware, USA, the vision is to make an Indian-owned world-class brand of home appliances that competes with the largest multinationals in the most advanced countries ie: the USA, Europe & Middle East by offering better product quality, service delivery, and value for money.","Best in its price range,Best suction power,Domestic Beast,Very good suction power and efficient,Beast of a Vaccum Cleaner ,Good built quality,Nice product with good suction power,Great Product","Purchased from Amazon for full price under no offers, still beat competitors by Rs.163Order was placed on Thursday 011222, late in the evening at 11 pm.Was to be Delivered on Thursday 081222 but arrived early on Monday 051222 at 10 am.Quite satisfied with the Delivery, Packaging, Condition of the item and also Happy with the early arrival.Along with the Vacuum we received a basic Instruction Manual and Warranty Card.The Invoice was missing from the parcel, so it had to be downloaded from Amazon.To Register your Warranty, you require to scan the Bar Code on the Invoice and WhatsApp the details.Without any delay, excitedly we got to assemble the unit which was a fairly easy task, took approximately 10 minutes, which I guess is ok for the first time while getting familiar with all various attachments etc.First impressions, the Vacuum itself looks sturdy built wise, but some attachments could be a little stronger. Especially, the extension pipes could be Stainless Steel same as the Drum and Telescopic in feature  operation. The main Vacuuming head attachment used for floor  hard surfaces could also be Stainless Steel as it gets used the most and gets banged around quite a bit, would extend its life.Its a 2 pin plug, instead of a 3 pin which could have been better with a surge protector fuse.The cord is of decent length, quite impressed with the quality of the cord. Also, the cord, which has no autowind and cannot be inserted within the body of the unit, after use can be rested on top of the Drum in a winding fashion, it kinda works and does keep in place without being a nuisance. Hose, same solution.The 2 side Latches are reasonably strong. Wheels are easy to install  insert and work fine.It would be absolutely fantastic if the various attachments could be stored  latched to the main unit while not in use, storage wise but can understand the limitations in this regard.First demo was for the Vacuum.Noise average not too loud or unbearable, reasonable with any other domestic Vacuum of similar power.Inside the lid, the dust bag clings on to its inlet, would be better if it could be secured  locked with a clip.In Vacuum suction mode the air gets forced out of the Blower outlet, this outlet is directed on the opposite side of the unit and is directed straight onto the floor level. Now imagine, if you had not yet cleaned that part of the room and that dust gets thrown around or blown onto the already cleaned surfaces, it would be an unending job like a dog chasing its tail. If this outlet had a removable or having the ability to rotate something like a flap or adjustable Ac vents like in cars, then it could direct the blown out air upwards while Vacuuming the surfaces and this could have been of great design sense.Suction is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts, nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing, does the job which is important.Then, follows the demo for the Blower.This feature should technically be equally as strong as the Vacuum, because the force of the air sucked in while Vacuuming is supposedly the same force leaving the Blower outlet. To make things interesting, there are fish gill like 2 vents on either sides of the Lid. These vents are the fixed kind, cannot be closed or opened. One of the vent very faintly can be felt takingin air, while the other vent blows out air at a significant force. This particular phenomena I am bewildered with, cause as I understand the escaping rate of air through this vent will weaken the force supposed to leave the Blower outlet. So make of it what you will. Still does the job, if youre looking at blowing leaves or scaring the neighbours pet.Finally, the demo for the Wet.Performance is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts and as other customers have described in their video demonstrations, again nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing, does the job which is important. May need to dry mop even after using the Wet function.In closingDefinitely do purchase it, use it often as required and also helps keeping fit,Do not allow dust to settle on your Vacuum Blower.Also ordered extrai American Micronic Replacement Dust Bag for AMIVCD211600WDx  AMIVCD151600WDxii RODAK 35 MM Mattress and Upholstery Nozzle for Vacuum Cleaner Wet and Dry Cleaning, EU Import,It have the best suction power among the wet and dry vaccum cleaner, even better than some of the dry vaccum cleaners. I bought this for my mother inlaw. She likes it for being easy to use. Its simple and easy to connect and remove dust covers and pipes, Extension pipes are little loose though. Its easy to clean those cat hairs now. And dont have to worry about accidentally sucking the water from the floor, because its Wet and dry vaccum cleaner. Hope the customer care is a good one incase of any needs arise. They send me already opened package, but not used I think. They could have send us a fresh unopened perfectly sealed package. No complaints untill now. I liked the reusable dust cover feature, also its easy to connect it inside. Easy to handle, dont have too much weight.It would have been better if there was an auto winding of power cables with a switch.,This is a domestic beast.... great suction.Only thing that should had been ther is speed control.Noise level is high, but with such suction is ok. As long as it cleans it all without ne to redo it again and again, I am ok...Rest how it will stay with time will be something to see.,It is very easy to clean as the suction power is great  very powerful machine indeed,I have been looking for a good vaccum cleaner for a long time now. I recently came across this and read the reviews etc. Some were good and some were bad. But at the same time I couldnt find any better specifications in any of the other vaccum cleaners  in this price segment so I finally bought it.It came in a big Amazon box well packed and secured. Unboxed and it was as perfect as in the stock images. Here is the list for you to understand the pros and cons as easily as possible  Very Good quality steel and plastic build The suction28kpa is really really good even with the thick carpets etc The wheels are really good too,They move effortlessly  You get a lot of accessories to clean different surfaces and theyre good quality  The blower function is really powerful  The bag inside,which collects the dust  dirt is big and can be cleaned  Washed easily  The noise level isnt much. Its okay, Not loud The cord length is 5mtrs which is enough  The overheating protection is Good All the Accessories can be stored at the given spaces on the baseCons The only thing that I think should be improved is the locking mechanism of the extension pipes. They are good and fit well but if its a carpet or some other mats youre cleaning you need to tighten it well otherwise it loosens and needs to be tightened again and again. Overall a 1010 Product which fits all your needs,Wet and Dry Cleaning of course .Better than any other Vaccum cleaners in under 10k price range . Go for it  P.s Ive tried some other Vaccum cleaners too which are in the 6k and above range but this is the all in one OP Vaccum Cleaner,Good suction with great built quality,Good durability,good suction power and quality product,Vacuum cleaner is very fine, suction power is quite good, drying power is also just OK,noise level is high as I expected. Cost is high as compared to other brands. Overall I rated it four star.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41tcKYuBPSL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

I use my blender almost every day. But the construction of the blender is such that the food often falls below the blades and I am constantly readjusting the ingredients to get the ingredients blended. It can take a considerable amount of time and a lot of patience. But this immersion blender can puree fruits and vegetables in less than 2 minutes and do it evenly and consistently. It is easy to use and lightweight. Cleaning consists of removing the shaft with the blades and handwashing it. You can wipe off the handle with a damp cloth and stick both in a drawer.

A worthy investment.","Non returnable, so now using this as it is. Bandwidth control is a must for this price range. Model was archer c80.,Great delivery from amaozn.  It was easy to setup as a extender . Signal is also good but not that great. It can cover 1 flat well . Signal breaks if moving upstairs or downstairs. Overall great purchase. Must buy,Need little better customer support,good,I expected much stronger signal 10 meter away. Its okay working, but not as expected.,tp link is good product,Good product,Decided on buying this Router from TPLink after days of research, reading reviews and talking to many people regarding different models.Was on a 20 Mbps connection with a Netgear N300 router since 2016 which used to suffice for moderate usage till now. However, with increase in the number of devices like Smart TV, 2 iPads and a laptop etc, it necessitated an upgrade. Also, considering the current workfromhome scenario which is bound to continue for the foreseeable future as well, the internet usage was being stretched to its limit and the trusted Netgear router simply couldnt match up to the increased bandwidth demand.To capitalise on the current situation, our current ISP came out with interesting Fibre broadband plans and we opted for a 75 mbps connection. That in turn needed a new router to utilize its optimum potential. Finally zeroed in on the TPLink Archer C80 after reading some horror stories of other available routers. Was also tempted to buy the AX1500 considering theres barely any price difference, but then came across a few reviews which stated that Wifi 6 is not entirely successfully implemented and might prove to be an hindrance to use with our current range of devices.Order delivered by Amazon within a day. Full marks for the seamless delivery as always. Prime has truly been a boon.Installed the Router today. Installation via Tether App was seamless. ISP guy helped with the PPPOE signin process and released the MAC ID which was bound to our old Router. The whole process was done in 10 mins and we were online.The dual bands are truly a boon. Have divided the devices at home equally between 2.4G and 5G as per usage. As the router is close to the TV unit, have connected it to 5G and also alternatively connected via the Ethernet cable just in case.Speed testsStarted off by streaming 4k content simultaneously on 2 devices connected to 5G. Played seamlessly even with other devices like mobiles etc being connected.Have attached a few pictures for reference. Sitting near the Router, 5G Download speed is 77 mbps and Upload is 75.4 mbps. 5G speed tested in the bedroom with a wall in between Download 72.4 mbps and Upload 74.9 mbps. 2.4G speed in the same room as the Router is Download 68.3 mbps and Upload 79.2 mbps. This is quite surprising as a few reviews mentioned 5055 mbps will be the threshold for 2.4G. Used to get a maximum of 45 mbps download on my old N300. Speed Test via the Ethernet cable provided in thr box connected to the TV Download 78 mbps and Upload 75 mbps.Couldnt have asked for more really. This seems to be totally ideal.Build quality of the device is decent and the antennas seem well enough to do the job, however would have preferred that they were placed like other TPLink models like the Archer A6, so it would have been easier to move them in preferred directions.The LED lights are a little weirdly placed and not bright enough. Maybe Im used to the prominent lights on my old Router. These are a blinkandmiss sort and you have to bend a little to check in case theres an issue. One big element missing in this device is a USB port which is absolutely essential in todays age and expected to be included for this price range. Wonder whats the reason behind giving it a miss.I have sealed the extra LAN ports with tape to protect from dust or moisture. Its a good practice. The outer design of the router is quite sophisticated and stylish, however Im a little worried of dust accumulating in the intricate design on the top portion.Functionally though, this seems to be a real good offering from TPLink. Hope this device lives up to expectations in coming days. Allinall, seems to be a worthy investment for the next few years, considering an internet plan upgrade, if any.Hope I touched upon major points which might help other interested consumers in making a choice. This product is RECOMMENDED! ",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41c7bJo7ooL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Has 3.5mm jack connector built in, you can use 14 connector if needed. It has very Long cable which measures upto 20 feet, so note that. It has absolutely NO noise isolation and normal smartphone earphones does better job of noise reduction compared to them in STOCK condition, but with SIMPLE EDITING this mic works just fine  Check the review below for detailed settings There are literally thousands of review on this product, but NONE explained the best possible settings for it when used with smartphone with Audacity software, or even in general. So I took the risk of ordering it and it turned out to be nightmare right out of the box, as the sound output was worse than my smartphone earphones. So I went to search for best settings on amazon  other sources but in vain. Fortunately I myself in experiments found the solution and now its working just fine.First I am mentioning all the pros and cons considering the settings that I found and then listing those settings,PROS 1. Built quality of the complete mic and cable is good for the price given.2. Length of cable is insane 20 feet. I personally didnt find it useful, as I use it with my smartphone which is just couple of feet below in my pockets, but for some users it can be very useful if using in rig setup with Camera.3. Has universal 3.5mm jack, which is handy.4. Its easy to use, just plug and play device, which doesnt need any sound card or external device to work.5. Has support for multiple device right from smartphones to DSLRs and computers.6. It comes with carry pouch which is very handy, since its a mess with such long cables.CONS 1. Biggest con is the sound quality right out of the box. Its just garbage quality and even normal ears cant bear the background noise collection, so forget about audiophiles. My normal smartphones earphones record much better sound quality compared to this.2. Length of cable is way too much for me and I guess for many users. I think there should have being multiple option on length to choose from, as keeping 20 feet cable wrapped and hanging or in pocket while recording is not comfortable.3. It comes with a button cell for recording sound for devices other than smartphone and theres NO way to know whether the battery is dead or whats its charging level. Only way to check is by plugging it to a digital recorder or computer and test. So if you are carrying it with recorder which doesnt has playback feature or if you are in hurry and in case of dead battery to record all the sound, then only way to find that your efforts are in vain will be when you comfortably sit to edit it and trust me, its very frustrating ! I am mentioning, it as this scenario have happened with me once, hence I am very cautious about batteries now  use it with smartphones or digital recorders.4. I think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less, considering the sound quality.BEST SETTING USING AUDACITY SOFTWARE These are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use Audacity software, which is Free !1. Open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic.2. Select entire audio clip and open Effects and then  DISTORTION 3. Start the playback of audio clip in the software, so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to make.4.Now select  Distortion Type  option on the top of box and select  Soft Clipping . or select  Hard Limiter  and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you.5. Take the Clipping Level cursor to extreme Right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output.6. Adjust the Makeup Gain cursor little bit if needed, I keep it on 49. Here you can select which ever type, which you feel is suitable for you.7. Now just click  APPLY .8. Now is Noise reduction. For that Select short section of audio which DOES NOT have your voice, but ONLY has background noises that you dont want.9. Open Effects and then  Noise Reduction 10. Click on  Get Noise Profile.11. Now select entire audio clip and again Open Effects and then  Noise Reduction .12. Finally, click on  OK  and thats it !Now you are good to go with soft, slightly lesser Noises and more pleasant sound output. After these steps, you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user software.VERDICT I personally am very disappointed with the sound quality, though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level, but its satisfactory enough. Plus price seems slightly more on this. I wouldnt recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment. Buy this only if you live in very silent conditions.,Its not great or best out there for beginners but goodI use a budget midrange phone and the boya mic is better than in built mic of phone. record it in WAV format, its good.You gotta use softwareapps to pull the best of this, like audacity or some other editing app.Its pretty long and thats good as you can extend the cable to a good distance say if u r connecting it to the camera on a tripod.Overall its decent for beginners. I see highend phones have good recording capabilities, but if you have a budget phone, then this one is deal.,Microphone looks very well built, it supports both phones and cameras. There are some phones that does not support external mic, please check before buying as one of my phone did not support it.They claim noise cancellation, however, I did not notice major difference it also captures great amount of noise, only cancellation is because of foam padding around the microphone. I could not observe noise cancellation, at least, while recording on phone.Overall package is well bundled, wire quality is decent, however the dongle quality is excellent, even the small clip to hold the microphone feels solid.,Wire is to long but good if quality of wire is improve in future then 5 stars from me but now 4 star good sound low price 1 star  for wire quality but over all a nice product.,I think Its good for online teaching like I do...But yeah some problems like very long cable length I mean someone might need but it should be optional.... or detachable price of the Mic itself is not much anywaysI am okay with this mic for sometime... until I am sure I need quality Rode mic to upgrade...,Dont expect noice cancellation under this budget but audio recording quality is very good.,Nice product,Decent",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UYenF+lnL._SX300_SY300_.jpg

OFF TAP and wait for another round of water heating then again fill bucket and leave the tap ON untill bucket filled with warm water.3. If u need more hot water repeat steps 1 2.Cons1. One need to purchase inlet  outlet pipes which costs around 400 as this was not provided by orient.Writing review after 20 days usuage.,Heater is so slow as compare to Bajaj heater ... currently i purchased this 1 but its not good,I have ordered two of them . Installed in bathroom as well . There is a trick to use it in bathroom. Either turn tap really slowly or by turning on tap at full sppeed. Whenever the the water get cold again switch of the tap , after 3 to 5 minutes again on and fill. Just this compromise you have to make in place of storage geysers.,Product body fitting is average. Be prepared to spend another 600700 Rs. on installation pipes, 16A plug and installation charges. No installation plate with geyser. To be mounted on screws. No safety valve supplied with geyser. Overall average product. Better go for Havells which comes with all accessories.,Easy to install.Temprature controller is not available with this product..Till date working good., on 7th feb 2021. Received as per delivery date. On opening found that the unit is wrapped with plastic and found water droplets. Maybe they tested the product before delivery. Coming to the product, it heats water to boiling temp in 34 minutes and you can expect 4 jugs of hot water only.Delivery55Packing15  since no bubble wrap or anything to protect the product.Product35 you should not design a product with such low capacity, now I am struck after buyingLooks55Will update more later...,First of all this is not a storage geyser. this is instant water heater. So better to understand the feature before using it. Just switch it on and wait for 12 min. it will start supplying hot water . As i told this is not a Storage geyser like 525 Ltr.  It comes with 3lts capacity only with 3KVA. So once the set temperature reach . Then Open the Hot water TAP in normalSlow running speed .So that it will continue supplying Hot water warm water. If the Hot water Tap will be fully opened with full speed then this instant water water will not get sufficient time to warm the water.

Good product,Great product at great price.,Value for money and instantly warm water comes in just 2min,Havella water heater,Water heats up in 4560 secs depending on the weather.This review is after using this water heater continuously for 1012 days in December, in Kolkata, with one of the days being extremely windy and lowest temperature at 1415 degree Celsius during afternoon early evening hours. On the coldest day so far, it took around 1min 1015seconds to heat up completely.If you dont have chronic pain, or arthritis, or this is not going to be used for very old people, whereby really hot water is required for bathing, I think it can work perfectly for winters with lowest temperatures upto 910 degrees, because I have chronic pain and use this to get really hot water and for a shower, not using a bucket, and its manageable.Obviously cant be compared to steaming hot showers using a storage geyser, but this heats quite quickly, so can be used in the shower even with the low capacity.For that same reason, it can be used for multiple people, because by the time one person leaves the bathroom and the next enters, youll have fully hot water, only of lesser quantity, so if you dont live someplace cold, or dont need very hot water but mildly hot water, this can be used for multiple people as well.Installation support was also good.No cons, only that if Havells introduces a 5l instant heater in the 4.5kW range, then that would be a game changer and might give storage geysers a run for their money because this is perfect for anyone who doesnt have their own home and might need to move around, because its compact, and provides instant hot water.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31991seDfcL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

I liked the design and it feels quite appealing.Now I have two problems with the headphones firstly being it cannot be put on for a longer period of time. Adds a little bit of stress over your ears and they start to ache not much though but thats quite a concern. Second being the length of the wire, its very long and often it annoys you because it doesnt get fit into pockets and all quite easily.

Sound is decent and loud. However as it doesnt have its own volume manager and only controls the systems volume, I have to keep the PC volume to 1 and still have to reduce volumes individually on apps and browser. SO somewhat of an inconvenience for me as I dont listen to things in loud volumes.Mic works fine however it s not exactly adjustable. Solid core surrounded by a spring so you have to bend it but it slowly goes back to an extent and the movement is limited.Cable is covered by very thick coating and seems durable, however, it is not free from interference. If your phone is near the cable you will hear the interference in the headphones.The light on the mic is static and does not indicate the mute status. Can be turned off alongside with other RGB lights on the headphone.You can hear some whine when some software is trying to access the mic and nothing is playing in the headphones.,1. 7.1 is Just Awesome2. The Software Is Very Good3. comfort Is Just Excellent, Not that Good noise cancelling4. I bought it for 1600 and in that price u cant get this type of product5.

The ears heat up easily and you can start sweating easily.,The product is as displayed and is really well built. But the upper part is of metal which adds to it premiumness makes it heavy. Someone who only uses AirPods or other TWS will find it difficult to adjust. The wire is long and braided and the controller works great too. No need for any external drivers to use the control in mobile devices as well. Works absolutely fine with OTG without compromising noise cancellation.Overall a great deal for 1299,Early reviewLikedLooks are greatWire goodSound good bass good treble goodMic level is goodInterface acceptableCan hear sound going from left to right  when enemy runningWorks on my mobile with otg good sound makes me happyDislikedFake add that its 7.1 there was no demo either how it becomes 7.1 like there should be an audio file to demo 7.1 or some sort of test to prove so actually its just a more organized stereo headset.... But its OK for this price like many other I know.... Real 7.1 will be Dam expensive and cant be sure how human ear will respond to that technique.... At this stage I am still not convinced that is even possible in the headset anyway...Microphone isnt steady and irritates keeps on going below lip levelMust have Been detachable atleast.please dont search for light in mic as its not in the white model ....one gets  confused upon watching videosPeople complain earpain but they dont understand it isnt heavy or tight but the deep loud bass causes earpain which they dont adjust.Buy it.,Great sound.

Functionality It has only two touch buttons which integrate all the functions like Units of weight  volume, multiple tare  weigh with overload indication, and offon It can give volume idications for water and milk, two of the most frequently used liquids, while other liquids can be also measured if a glass of water is calibrated for a certain volume, say 100 ml ad same is marked on the glass The plastic food grade bowl fits snugly on the scale and also doubles up as a cover when the scale is not in use2. Duraility Because of its squat oblong shape and sure footing, the scale wont topple. Also, since bowl fits snugly on the scale upside down when the scale is not being used, it prevents dust from entering the display and buttons material is tough plastic with a recessed top which seats the bowl firmly and there is no exposed space for ingress of any spilt liquid, With all this, theres a one year warranty extendable to two years, which speaks about the confidence of the manufacturers in their own design3. Battery Life The device has an auto power off and a digital display which consumes very less power. Hence battery is likely to last longer.I only encountered two cons1. Scale is very sensitive and takes some time to settle2. The display backlight goes away after some time and the lcd reading is difficult to read in bright ambient light.Overall, this device serves my purpose of practical diet management very efficiently and effectively and am sure it will grow on me.

The housings are ergonomically shaped housings and angled at 45 degrees. They do not fall out of the ears easily, even during intense activities. The silicone tips are nothing to write home about, but that is expected considering the price.There is a threebutton inline remote with mic located right below the right earpiece, which can be used to answer calls, control music playback, and trigger the voice assistant on your smartphone. The buttons themselves are quite mushy and difficult to distinguish between by touch alone.Xiaomi Mi Earphones performanceXiaomi claim that the Mi Earphones feature a 3rd generation balanced damping system that creates a transparent sound, and metal sound chambers created via a 20step process. Marketing fluff aside, how do the earphones really sound Simply put surprisingly decent for earphones that cost less than a nice dinner for two.While most earphones in this price range have overinflated bass that dominates the rest of the frequency range, the bass response on the Mi Earphones is controlled and restrained. It doesnt overwhelm the sound signature or smother the highs. That said, bassheads will be left slightly wanting.Its surprising to hear that highs are present and distinct in the sound mix, although they do get overpowering sometimes. The mids are slightly repressed, which is evident in vocalheavy genres such as blues. While the clarity on offer is decent for the price, songs with many layers of instrumentation do sound muffled and noisy. This is most evident in complex genres such as rock and metal in which the earphones sound harsh and the mids get buried by the treble and bass.,This earphone set is fantastic. And highly deserving of money. I used it for a while last in 2022, and now Im buying it once more in 2023. In my perspective, the Mi headset has good music and is easy to use.,good good,Nice product.Gentle bassNo loud soundProduct quality is decentDont expect heavy music experience,Its sometime uncomfortable but its fine i can adjust,Seriously if you are a bass lover, then you can go for it.But its built quality is not good, it will damage automatically after 34 months,it is not suitable for rough uses.,Got it for less than 300rs. Not disappointted at all.If you compare it with other brands like Boat, the sound quality isnt as good as the contemporaries. But for the price I paid, Im not disappointed at all.The bass is solid. Noise cancellation is average and the earphones are a little low on volume, couldve been louder.Good value for money product for earphones under 300.,Very Good product as expected",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Rn5CAJDBL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

I have used it for a month now and no issues. Good product.,Works fine with my Samsung smart TV. No issues till now,Does everything the original remote does.,Not a genuine product.

You cant iron more than 2 clothes before water refill.Since the mouth area is not that much, youll need to move it so many times slowly on the whole cloth.Steam amount is fine but design is such that you cant press it hardly on to the cloth during ironing.So overall do keep in mind before buying that its only for emergency  travel purpose for dewrinkling already ironed clothes.,Good product. Does what it says. Though the water tank could have been bigger.,better to buy normal iron box,Takes a lot of time and is not very easy to use. You will need to use the conventional iron even after using this steamer for most of the clothes. Works only for the synthetic fabrics. Its better to stick to the conventional iron.,Hiii the water tank is too small and can only use for one shirt or T shirt,so plz concentrate on this also,Absolutely good. Easy to handle and flexible movement. It took me less than 5 mins to iron Kurti.Advice to users  please follow the instructions carefully, have some patience and it works great.Negative  Water chamber is very small and it takes 1 full tank to iron 1 shirt1 kurti.,The Product is good, unfortunately it came withou a manual. I had to figure our where the water tank was and use it . Otherwise the product works well.,Very low water storage is what put me off. Otherwise its just ok. Does the job.

The handheld model would be better suited and more useful for frequent use.,I used this product once after reading the manual. The first impression after using it on 3 cotton shirts without starch and one pant is pathetic. None of the shirts got wrinkle free on full steam, hence you could guess what it would be in trousers.Later I found it is satisfactory on silk, nylon shirts, T shirts etc but none will get an iron effect. Wrinkle will be there in small amount and a slight wet feel when the steam cool down but it will go if fast.It is mainly useful for ladies who wear embroidered nylon, silk materials, stone work fabrics, etc etc men who use T shirts and nylon rich trousers. Otherwise, dont even think of buying it. In my case, I use cotton whites and white trousers mainly at office as I am a lawyer. Hence, for me, it is totally useless. No females at home and hence, it is another product that grab my home space.Regarding comfort while using it, I would say, I am totally disappointed as the board behind it is not much of use while using g shirt because of its size which is not that long. The last two button downwards will always hard to press it to board and we have to take the hanger hold high on one hand and thus another difficult part as the nylon material needs another hands to hold it firm. Secondly, the long full sleeves are totally difficult to do it though steam is applied, the wrinkles wont go easily add we are not pressing it to board and it will always go here and there. The top stand is a hanger shaped but the clips attached as useless as the board comes in between. For trousers, the product itself wont work good. So if we use the hanger it comes with, you need to put the switch off, place the handle in slot, take the shirt out and then only we can use the back side to steam after waiting again to steam up switch on etc otherwise steam will go on coming out of it.Any way, the product is more useful that those similar without a pressing board.The next negative thing is, manual says, for better lasting of product, and  to avoid decalcification, the water After use should be drained and cleaned. Hence, it means, you cant use it daily morning in rush while going to office. That needs little time. At the same time you cant press all dress in a stretch and cant fold it like we do with iron box. It wont work that away. So if you have long large cupboard with hangers as in mansions, you can try that.In effect, buy it if you find exceptions and usages apart from what I mentioned above.P.S  I am seriously thinking of OLX ,Received a broked packedge. With broken item.,I thought it would make my task of ironing easy but its useless on cottons and silks . Its great to use it on chiffon and polyester. Do not buy thinking you wont need standard ironing anymore..,It is fantastic for marriages, where there are many dresses, net based where you cant use iron. Quick. Good for suits,It looks like an imitation product , pieces dont match properly and some look very weak,valu Ed for money,Its not effective and pressing clothes effectively seems to have an issue",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/318JzFxYqtL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

So, I decided to buy this router to use as an access point. The setup is pretty straightforward, provided you know what you are doing.As is mentioned on the product page, this router comes with two modes  router mode and access point mode. If you are using it in addition to your ISP provided modemrouter, I would suggest using it in the access point mode only.The range and the speeds are working better than I expected for the price  certainly better than the router that the ISP provides. The router does come with a LAN cable, but the quality of the cable is not very confidence inspiring. The LEDs on the front can be configured via the Tether app to switch off at specific times, which is a neat feature. Apart from that, I have found Tether app to be pretty useless. It doesnt specify the device identity for some reason, just shows the IP and unknown, until you rename the device yourself. Sometimes it doesnt even list all the devices connected. I guess it is better to use the router settings from the browser itself if you want to dig into the settings.I would like to add one more thing in the end. This router looks pretty slick, and I dont think it has gotten enough credits for that. Kept on the table, or even hung from the wall, it looks and feels premium for the price  and that is in addition to all the amazing features it has.,Router gets sometime auto disconnected even though it is connected to internet,I dont have any issue with router but sure with Amazon packaging method bcz no paper bag or anything were used it was only the box,Good product for that price.

Things to make note of 1 When you boil keeping all 7 eggs at a time, therere chances of slight breaking of 1 or 2 eggs which in my case but works fine if you try with 6 or 5 or lesser no. 2 The wire is short so youll need to have plug point nearer to the base or use a stool. 3 The boiled eggs are slight softerwhites than the usual eggs that are boiled on stove but youll get accoustemed to it. 4 Can be used only to boil eggs and frying directly is not working. 5 Measuring cup is provided and can be used to measure water for soft, medium or hard boiling of eggs, very convenient to boil the eggs. Good for everyday use. Only problem is the wire is very very short, just 1ft, it makes bit tricky to use, as you need to put something below so that the plug could reach the socket, atleast they should have provided 1mtr length wire.Cleaning is easy but as it has air openings at bottom you need to carefully wash it.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31-RWRwJZOL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Have been using the 3M, but its very expensive if you consume 4to 5 rollers every month. So thought of trying this one as i though how bad can a lint roller be. The stickiness of the glue paper was good enough to remove the dog hair, but the quality of the handle is really bad. It did not even last 2 days. So ended up using a wooden stick or long pencils for the job. If the makers had spent some more on making a good handle even if the cost would have been Rs 25 higher, then it could have been a great product especially for those households which have pets as they need it more frequently. So i might go back to buying the 3M product of look for something in between.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Fo2P8-4ZL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

I use it for mobile vlogging.,Noice cancellation is not working,Value of money ,Good mike, worth money,Very nice mic in this price range.,After seeing many microphone. I found thisI bought it becuase of its good ratings and reviews and in a buget price. This is best for beginners,The first time I had ordered this mic, I received in a amazon plastic bag and the product box inside was completely damaged and was sealed using cello tape. Also, the mic seller sent me was damaged and had low quality audio. It was a duplicate.But, when I replaced, I received the packing in a cardboard box but still the inner box had a few damages.The mix received inside was good.Here is a detailed review of the mic1. The quality Quality overall nice. The wire might seem filthy and weak but in reality when I tested it, it was indeed a bit durable. It can easily sustain a bit of a pull and twist. Just mind the spots when the wire meets the audio jack and the mic2. Sound quality Sound quality is really nice. BUT BUT BUT... before you think of buying it, read the paragraph below of noise cancellation. The mic catches sound equally even if you are from far away or close to it.3. Noise Cancellation This is a major point. I used to mic a lot for testing purposes. Let me share my experience. I tested it in different environments.a. In a closed room with AC and total silence In such environment, you will get crisp sound like a boom microphone. But, you will also receive a bit of white noise or background static noise which you can easily reduce using the noise reduction feature.b. In a room with ceiling fan on and moderate noise Still seems good but not great. Your vocals would still be crispy and clear but the background noise will increase. Still if you use nice noise reduction software like Audacity it will sound great. Adding background music to your video would help.c. In a room with standing fan on and high noise Not recommended at all. Not only this mic but any mic would capture a TON of noise. To express statistically, there will be atleast 40 noise of wind whooshing in the background.d. The same high noise room with windows open You will die doing noise reduction. Not gonna lie, the background noise increases by 60 times.  DONT TRY THIS.The pop filter or the sponge on the top of the mic helps a lot. When you are speaking close to the mic, a lot of air goes in while speaking. So, when the filter is attached, the output sound does not have air whooshing but with the filter removed, the output sound is only air.Now, to sum up...Mic is overall good. Noise cancellation is not great but yeah, for the price range, it is the best!Recording tips1. Record in a silent room with AC or else turn on the fan at the least speed so it doesnt make much noise.2. Use the collar clip to place the mic, dont hold it in hand.  I mean this is common sense P 3. If transmission lines electricity wires which are above the head go from close to your room, I would recommend changing rooms.Now, the reason for this is that sometimes, the mic can catch electromagnetic intefrerence.  This maono mic wont catch it but I recommend this for generic mics.4. Do noise reduction in Audacity. It is very effective than the inbuilt noise reduction tools in video editors. Also, it is very easy.Also, BOYA BYM1 MIC SOUNDS ALMOST THE SAME AS THIS MIC. There is only like 2 difference in noise cancellation. But, I would still give both of them 3 stars for noise cancellation.THATS IT!Hope you understand what I mean to say.Peace out.,Nice ",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/413viCgpI+L._SY300_SX300_.jpg

Sound quality is good. Fitting in ear is perfect which has been constantly an issue with other earphones I have used till now.I have doubt on its durability because its wires are kind of handlewithcare. If it is durable then it will be among one of the best earphones, I have used till now.,Unable to hear after, 8 months,Good budget earphones for taking call and listening to music watching videos once in a while. Be careful with the wire though as it can get tangled easily and is not that strong.,Best buying in these range,The C50 HI is a budget friendly in ear earphone and it really comes at a great price.But the next version of these i.e. C100SI has more value for money factors.Like C50 HI has angled 3.5mm jack whereas C100SI has the normal one and i am not supposed to say this but trust me C100SI has the best best best and superior sound quality if I compared to C50HI.Though it doesnt have a great durability.But if your previous earphones were c100si and you are switching on these then one can definitely notice the difference between the c100si and c50hi although you can adapt the sound of c50hi in nearly about 1 week if you are switching from c100si.To be honest the c100si is literally best in all circumstances such like gaming,Listening to music and professional editing the vocals,mids highs lows are perfectly balanced in c100si but not c50hi.in c50hi mostly when listening to sing the bass was not up to mark and the vocals were so loud that the bass was literally fading main point is that whenever we hit the full volume both of them never distorted any single beat.Hats off to harman.,Good earphones short time usage.,Its good with very clear voice and average Bass clarity. I am not giving 5 stars because certain Bass can be improved a bit more. Overall its a good one.,Was looking for budget earphones with voice clarity, JBLC50 HI does the work. Except for bass quality there nothing else to complain about.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31rmf+p45oL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

You need to use clean cloth with wetted with water. You can use some liquid soap but make sure it gets cleaned with clean cloth. Apply some butter or ghee on both side of bread before making sandwiches else it will stick to your plates in grill.,Overall good.,It is Ok but does not look sturdy enough.The top and lower heaters are not parallel if the sandwich is a little thick.A little better design would have avoided this problem,Makes the breads go crunchy from soft. 1010 would recommend.,Very nice easy to use except there is no temperature control knob .

Go for bassheads 242 if you are spending this much. They are charging more for the metal enclosure and the braided cable. The angled jack is a plus but the sound quality is soso. Infinity zip 100 and their own bassheads 242 are way better for sound.,I would like to start by saying Im not an audiophile, therefore my review will be less about the audio quality of the product and more about the over all experience regarding the product. First off, this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it, its good enough that I will buy it a third time if need be!Upon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of 3 pair of extra ear buds . There is also a pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds, these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is a chance of lots of movement. More on this later.Coming to the ear phones itself, its among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand. It is very durable, specially the plug part that connects to your phone, many a time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones. This is not the case with these.The wire itself is made of rubbersilicon. It feels good in hand and the only thing I can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasnt showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires. Another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out, this genuinely decreases the number of instances where I find myself trying to untangle the wire. This is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphones.Remember I said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal Well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter. Both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin. I dont know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face. It is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume, personally this problem didnt affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breaker.Mic quality is subject to individual bias therefore I can tell you my personal experience. In my opinion I feel that the quality is average, it wont blow anyones mind but it will deliver most of the time. A common complaint I heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic, these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boAt BassHeads 152Finally the most important part of the review, the sound quality of the ear phones. As I said earlier I wont be going into the technical details . I am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place. In my opinion I found that the Bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the Extra bass versions of the Sony line up of earphones trend to be. The volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not I use it at less than half its total volume when listening to music. The clarity of the boAt BassHeads 152 are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the 2000 INR price category this is one other reason why I love this pair so much. A point to remember, as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones. This becomes a double edged sword, on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic. This causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used. The find unlike the ones find in lets say the newer Bose ear phones arent as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged time.Last but not the least, there are multiple color variants of the boAt BassHeads 152 including red, black and blue. I found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but I find it to be the best of the three. That said I do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color. This leaves out the red, for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales, therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they last.Pros1 No metal build2 Excellent wire quality and trendy3 Durable4 Above average sound qualityCons1 Metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily2 Supplied Fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time3 Supplied Clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyI hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the BassHeads 220. All suggestions are welcome.Thanking you, Dwarakesh,Best quality  I like boat earphone saund quality,Only disadvantage  I noticed was this cant be use in USB phones,  3.5 mm jack is provided so it can be  usedin Jack phones only .,Nice,good,I used this headphone for travel.

Just the warranty registration and Invoice copy.A very satisfying experience .,Its almost 4 months purchasing the product now, Doing and last well so far no complaint., ,While charging my laptop, this charger gets heated up more than the original charger.

The charging speeds isnt as good as the original one but for quarter the price its okey.,I initially ordered this charger in 2020 during the height of the pandemic as the original apple charger seemed too expensive at rs. 7500.Worked well for 8months before dying and I replaced it within warranty, the replacement was quick and effective. 3 months later, replacement died too, so I ordered a new one. Same story repeated again,for 8 months the original one worked and the replacement worked for 3 months.It is a good charger if you want to use it as an alternative to apple, however remember that it costs 14th so it also works for 14th the life. Charges the laptop just as well as the original.TLDR  its like a yearly subscription based charger, will work well for a year, then you have to order a new one.,Value for money and as far as now its working perfectly. Quality wise also not that bad.,The charger is working fine on my macbook 13 inch retina display for the. past 5 months",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Wm6eo+yYL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy like traveling in bike,or a busy streetBut remember if youre getting calls continuously itll less the battery backup.Sound quality Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but its that not punchy.but dont you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80,Alright. So I have been using Boult ProBass Curve for over a month and would like to summarize my feedback in bulletpoints to make it easy for the prospective buyers. I was thinking to buy a quality Bluetooth headset with a great performance at an affordable price for quite long and this is where my search ended. I was quite fed up of using cheap wired headsets as they used to go out of function or get snapped every now and then. Moreover, I found them getting entangled every other second making it really inconvenient to handle especially while travelling. Its that time I started feeling the need of a wireless headset and began my search. I took good time months to look for a good product. And, this is when I decided to purchase this item. Before purchase I devoted time to read the users reviews that I always do before making any purchasesmall or big and found myself convinced. Finally, I decided to go for it. Ok. So, no more essay writing  Let me get straight to the key points1. I bought this for 999 under Sale so saved INR 499. its a good saving. As Warrent Buffet says every penny saved is every penny earned2. This has great sound quality. I could not compare it against any other product because I dont have any other bluetooth headset with me  But this will surely not let you down. It is very loud even at 80 volume level. You just cannot listen to at that level forget about full volume. Bass is great but not outstanding to be honest but it does not disappoint either. Good thing is the sound does not distort even if you raise it to 100. Excellent sound clarity!3. I am not a technocrat so cannot tell what are the characteristics of noise cancellation feature but you will not get to hear any external soundnoise or very very minimal that is not noticeable. So, this stands perfect at this point.4. Performs excellent while taking a call. You will a get a crystal clear voice when you maketake a call using this device. You will feel as if you are making calls directly from the mobile phone. In fact, its even better at times when the voice from the other side is low. I really love the handsfree calling because I have to take long calls with the clients in my job.5. Battery backup is excellent!!! It can last anywhere from 10 to 11 hours. I have tested it rigorously in both audio and video usage. And, I mean it. I tested it for almost a month with daywise log capture. Please see the detailed tracking at the end. It gets full charged in 2 hours approx.6. Bluetooth range is good. It covers a distance of 10 to 15 feet easily. Its quite enough if not good enough. My figures may be wrong. Beware! Its just my rough estimate. Havent tested is rigorously.7. Design looks good and is very convenient to wear. The wires are adjustable as per need. This is a nice thing. Looks cool when you wear it around your neck. I chose Red color.8. Last but not the least. It comes with 1 year replacement warranty so you can sleep peacefully while enjoying your favorite music Judgement Just go for it if you have a limited budget or dont want to spend a fortune on bluetooth headset. I was hesitant to spend anything beyond 1000 bucks on a bluetooth headset. It was my personal limitation.PS Battery backup log16 May 1 hour 15 minutes approx in the evening video play17 May 1 hour 15 minutes approx in the morning song play  WebEx call with Suneel17 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the afternoon song play17 May 1 hour approx in the evening video play17 May 1 hour 20 minutes approx at night video play20 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play20 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the evening video play21 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play21 May start 22 minutes approx video play in the eveningBattery deadTotal battery time 11 hour 12 minutes22 May 1 hour 35 minutes approx in the morning song play22 May 1 hour approx in the evening video play23 May 1 hour 35 minutes approx in the morning song play23 May 1 hour approx in the evening video play24 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play24 May 1 hour 10 minutes approx in the evening video play26 May 27 minutes approx in the evening video play27 May 1 hour 29 minutes approx in the morning song play27 May 1 hour 27 minutes approx in the evening video playTotal time 11 hr 13 minutes28 May 1 hour 46 minutes approx in the morning song play28 May 1 hour 17 minutes approx in the evening video play29 May 1 hour 57 minutes approx in the morning song play29 May 1 hour in the evening video play30 May 1 hour 48 minutes approx in the morning song play30 May 55 minutes approx in the evening video play31 May 1 hour 24 minutes approx in the morning song play10 hour 07 minutesBattery discharged31 May 1 hour 12 minutes approx in the evening video play03 June 1 hour 38 minutes approx song play in the morning03 June 1 hour 17 minutes approx video play in the evening04 June 1 hour 28 minutes approx song play in the morning04 June 1 hour 11 minutes approx video play in the evening05 June 23 minutes approx video play at night06 June 1 hour 47 minutes approx song play in the morning06 June 50 minutes approx video play in the eveningTotal time 9 hour 46 minutesBattery discharged07 June 8.34 am start song play 10.06 end 1 hour 32 minutes approx07 June 6.47 pm start video play 7.53 pm end 1 hour 10 minutes approx08 June 11.38am start song play 12.37 59 minutes approx end 2.16pm start song play 4.04 pm 1 hour 48 minutes approx end10 June 8.37 am start song play 10.14 am end 1 hour 37 minutes approx10 June 6.27 pm start video play 7.46pm end 1 hour 19 minutes approx11 June 9.10am start song play 10.51am end 1 hour 41 minutes approx11 June 6.55 pm video play 7.46pm end 51 minutes approxBatter dischargedTotal time 10 hour 57 minutes approx,You have to purchase a headphone I recommend for this one. Under 1000 rupees best one..,No battery backup and no flexible to use, they dont satisfied with provided features,I am writing this review after used of 30 days the product is really very good, sound quality, durability, battery performance is also very good,Overall its a fair product...Rs. 899...with all the features...Its perfect for daily commute since it has a very good battery life, it will last for 3 to 4 days easily.When it comes to the sound quality, i feel its not delivering as advertised which is obvious. It would be wrong to expect great sound from an overall product. You cant have everything at once. This is my personal opinion, since i am a music enthusiast and have experienced music from great headphones and ear phones.Other than that its worth trying, totally recommend this product if you daily travel for work and you are looking for a budget wireless earphone,Sound quality is not best,I LIKED THIS PRODUCT.

I went with the trust on Bosch brand name and am extremely satisfied with the product. I have been using it daily, sometimes multiple times in a day for past month during lockdown period. I hope this will help others.Mixer includes capacity 1 Mixer body1 Plastic blender jar 1500ml  fruit filter,1 Wet grinding jar 1500 ml1 Dry grinding jar 1000 ml1 Chutney grinding jar 400 ml1 extra Pounding Blade1 SpatulaBuild and overall appearance1. The mixergrinder 1000 watt motor is extremely powerful.I have used it to grind both dry  wet ingredients such asgaram masala, idlidosa mix, Chana dal paste, Poppy seeds paste,coconut chutney, dry rice and urad dal powder, ginger garlic paste, ice, etc.I regularly blend and make milk shakes, lassis etc and have found it to very fast and convenient.2. Does the job fast within few secondsminutes depending on the amount and type of ingredients you are working with.3. Body is good looking, sturdy, well balanced and easy to wipe clean.4. The vacuum feet are quite secure and give a true hands free experience.5. Overload protector for added safety helps if you overload the mixer by mistake.6. The jars also are easy to use and quite wellbuiltJars  Blades1. The jars are metal with removable stainless steel blades.2. Chutney jar blade is fixed.3. An extra blade is provided for stone pounding affect.4. A spatula cum blade changer is provided.5. The Jar lids are made of transparent plastic.6. Each lid has a small top cap which can be removed to add liquidsmaterials while grindingblending.7. Each lid has rubber gaskets. This gives a completely leak proof experience while grindingblending. These gaskets are very easy to remove and attach.8. All Jars have 4 fibre clasps to close the jars.9. In the blender jar a juicer attachment has been provided  this is the only thing I have not used, hence I cannot review the performance of this attachment.10. Blender can be used without the juicer sieve, and works fine.11. In wet blender a flowbreaker is providedSoundSound is high, but that is to be expected in a powerful 1000 watt machine.Dos  DontI feel if we follow certain guidelines we can best out of the product1. Do not overload2. Do not use for more than a minute without giving a little rest.3. When turning the speed knobs  dont turn all at once from 0 to max. You will see that it works better if you turn knobs slowly, staying at each speed for a few seconds. Actually for most things  low to medium speed is enough. The machine is really powerful.4. When grinding large amount of ingredients the jar can heat up  not the machine so give a little rest in between.5. For wet grinding  use cold water to grind  that way the jar will never heat up.6. DO NOT grind hot ingredients. Many people have complained about the rubber gaskets melting  that can only have happened if hot food are being blended or ground. Bring food to room temp and then grind.7. Wash the jar, gasket, jars immediately using a sponge and liquid detergent so that the shine of the jar remains intact.8. Always remove and wash the gasket to avoid unhygienic conditions as food can get under the gaskets.9. In the wet blender remove the flow breaker by sliding it off and wash it separately as food particles can get stuck behind it.10. To remove fine particles when dry grinding dont use a spoon to avoid scratches to the jar. You can use your hand and a brush  used for this purpose only.11. This is an expensive piece of equipment  In my house only I  my husband use it. We do not allow  children or household helpcooks to use it. This way the machine will not be misused.12. If you mixer does not work   please check the overload protector button on the underside of the machine. Remove some of the ingredients and try again.13. Take care while handling jar lids and lid tops  Although they appear quite well made, I cannot say if they will break when dropped.Pros1. The machine is very powerful and delivers what it promises2. It is easy to use and gives truly hands free experience3. Easy to clean4. Grinds and blends everything5. Leakproof lids.6. Takes very little time to grind7. The motor does not heat up even easily8. The overload protector works perfectlyCons1. Guarantee  Manual  The Manual has to be downloaded from the Amazon websiteThe Amazon payment is the guarantee. There is no separate guarantee card provided. I had to call Amazon to understand the situation regarding the guarantee card.2. Delivery  The mixergrinder came in a box but there was no special Styrofoam padding. This was a big minus for me.3. A couple of extra lid clasps should be provided  one of my lid clasps was loose, it is working fine at the moment, but as a backup company should provide these.4. As the jars are pretty large, for smaller amount of products it is a little difficult. I wish the smallest chutney jar was usable for both dry  wet grinding rather than only wet.5. The jars do have screws heads on the inner side  but this is not a big deal  and can be cleaned quite easily.,Review after using for few monthsPros The lock feature is really good for hands free usage. Grinds very fast. Say, half cup soaked urud dal can be ground to paste in less than 4 minutes. Juicer is good, extraction is good for the juicy fruits. Good design and takes less space in kitchen.Cons Noise is there for the power it grinds. But anyway not that high as mentioned in some reviews which I read before my purchase.Steel jars get heated up quickly. So I used to refrigerate the soaked rice or dals to balance the heat.Just need to be careful while cleaning as there are some sharp edges which could hurt a little.wet grinding jarTips clean the jars immediately after use to make the cleaning easy with sponge. So that jars wont loose its shine ,I bought this Bosch mixer on 2020 and the motor is not working I have to buy another mixer what is the use of putting such a big amount in it.it worked only for 2 years.it was only for household purpose i purchased.very much disappointed with a brand.Showed to their mechanical he said motor is burnt from inside .,True to its name the Bosch Mixer Grinder is a great machine to have in your kitchen. However the locks of the cap have given away and cleaning it is a challenge.,NA,This is a very good product overall. The dosaidli and other such batters come out excellent. The motor is powerful and can handle any mixing and grinding needs.The only unsatisfactory thing about this is the juicer. It works well with slightly watery fruits like citrus, oranges, watermelon, etc. But the moment it comes to fruits and vegetables with a lower water content, the juicer fails at extracting anything. The juicer is basically another blender jar with a mesh attachment to sieve out the pulp. There is no option of being able to push the fruits closer to the blender blade which makes it difficult to crush them.All in all an excellent product as long as you stick to the citrus juices.,I was a happy customer of Sujata for the past 10 years and Bosch was a a good optionGood design, powerfull motor , worth for the price i bought 5500 in offer ,It has a powerful motor, does grinding pretty fast. Compact size. Lid lock clip very useful. Priced high. Juicer function is not much useful.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/51bVSwhFA1L._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

READ ON!,Excellent sound quality, i like this speaker sooooooo much ","This is review is primarily focused on sound quality.The term Bass is used losely. One doesnt expect true Bass from such small drivers.SHORTER VERSIONBoat Stone 650 Very loud. Loud and somewhat uneven bass. Mids are a bit supressed. Somewhat muffled midrange. Decent treble. A loud bassy speaker.Nakamichi Speck Barely louder than the 3W Stone 200. Mids clearer than 650. Bass much much lower than 650. If looking for VFM rule this one out, unless this is on a big discount and others arent. Overall fairly even sound, at a questionable price and volume.Boat 200 More bass than expected of a tiny 3W speaker, but lesser than Speck, and way lesser than 650. Excellent midrange and terble. Much lounder than what you may expect of a 3W speaker. Amazing speaker in a tiny package, with insufficent bass.LONGER VERSIONI have had the 200 for years and many have asked me to order it for them. It is an excellent tiny satisfying package. The midrange, vocals and treble is excellent, and matches speakers several times it price. If bass is not what you are after, you are unlikely to find a better package even at a much higher price point, especially if you care for even sound.By Even Sound, I mean all relevant frequencies produced fairly well  no major suppression or enhancementI checked the others as I usually hear music on a semipro system, and the insufficent bass lowermids bothered me.Nakamichi USED to be a Japanese company making very high end tape decks in the 90s so the benchmarks were high now it is a China based company. The 25W raised expectations further. As said, it is barely louder than the 3W Stone 200. It is fairly even sound, but not a significant enough improvement in bass over the 200. If you dont care about the money, and want something better, than the 200 with even sound, this could be it. The mids and terble, are a tiny bit better in the 200. Speck also has a larger battery, giving substantially longer backup, and better water protection useful if you use yours in the smallest room of the house  The Stone 650 is miles ahead in bass and loudness. if that is what you care for, amongst the 3  your choice is simple. The bass is uneven, however. All three speakers have memberanes in the inner shell acting as passive bass radiators. One should not expect much nuance in bass from those. If a thump is what you care for  yes it is certainly there for the size. With somewhat uncontrolled bass, the midrange is compromised  somewhat suppressed and somewhat muffled. No, it is not major, and many mgiht not even really notice it much. The transiton between mid and lowermidsbass isnt great. One usually doesnt expect as much from such speakers, but the Boat Stone 200 set the bar high  very high.Keep the boat stone at an angle such that the drivers speaker are in the direction of your ears. It makes the midrange a bit better. Reduces the bass a bit, but makes the sound more even. Tough it is impractical to keep it so, it makes the sound a lot closer to what I desire.SOME EXTRASPlacement of these speakers makes a big difference. Keep them about 6 away from a wall ideally a corner for enhanced bass and fuller sound.If you look at teardown videos, youll notice that the 650 has much bigger magnets than the others. It is a heavy speaker. I like that, since it keeps it stable and the rubber on the side helps further. It is well designed, except the  and  volume buttons should have been interchanged for intuitive use.The 650 can also be placed vertically. That too changes the sound. Lesser bass, and possibly a bit clearer on the whole reduced bass  less intrusion into the mids, in such speakersSpeaker characterics change subtly over 100 odd hours of use. Often quite prominent in the first hour, so do not form an opnion before running them in for about an hour.ConclusionNakamichi Speck More even sound than the other two, not at all as loud as expected, better waterprof rating, bigger battery, high priced, despite Chinese  Buy if you dont care for the money, volume and are okay wihtout much bass.Boat Stone 200 it is a star! Excellent even sound, however the lack of bass as compared to the others pulls it back. If you are on a budget, or if you dont care much for bass especially for lecturesdocumentaries or vocal music this is brilliant. I have used it for long.Boat 650 Heavy. Loud. Lots of bass. If you can deal with the somewhat and it is not big unevenness and slightly muffled sound  it is a good package.For my needs, I added the 650 to my equipment list, while keeping the 200.PS This was my way of giving back to the community for the numerous reviews I have gained from.,Sound,Its okay to buy,Sound is not much loud, its below my expectations,1. Low price2. Awesome sound3. Battery life should be more so cutting down 1 star but overall good4. Gives feeling of home theatre5. Multiple connectivity is also good.,Loved the product,,",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41rfSd9spqL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Blower function works as expected. A bit tough to clean mosquito mesh through grills.,I have been using this vaccume cleaner for the last 1 month. And I am very happy with the product ...I have been using it mostly for Sofa Cleaning....its suction power is really good., pipe should have more length, cant reach slabs, other wise nice",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41--5lc96UL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

And not good for deep cleaning. I tried to clean matresses and sofa but dusts were there.,Too early to write the review but working good so far,Likes Handy, easy to use, comparatively light Cleans extremely well due to strong suction power. looks good. Good clean design. power cord is very long. easy to store, doesnt take up much spaceDislikes heated up quite a lot within 2 minutes not even 5 minutes after cleaning an upholstered stool and foot rug. Had to switch off and let it cool. So obviously not something that can be used at a stretch to clean all your upholstery etc. like othermore expensive vacuum cleaners no flexible hose with the more expensive version with extension stick. When one has paid much more, providing the small flexible hose which is meant for cleaning inaccessible areas like underneath sofas, ceilings etc, was something i expected. Im sure the hose itself is pretty inexpensive. They could easily have provided it at no extra cost. If one needs that hose, one needs to buy the less expensive unit again! just to get the hose as its not even available for sale separately. manual is hopelessly inadequate, had to look up YouTube videos. no soft brush provided for cleaning the filter. does not come in Amazon packaging even though its fulfilled by Amazon. Its just the Agaro box, think is closed by openable flaps, not even sealed. So we cannot be sure if its a returned defective product or brand new one. No quality check sticker or anything assuring that the product has been checked before packing. On a YouTube video, there was a sticker at the joint of dust connector and main body, on mine there is no sticker, just slight sticky residue. So its been removed by someone. Not sure if its a returned product again as there is no seals on the box. I dont want to return this as i already had returned one box that was filthy with oil stains and had opened from the bottom flaps had come apart, none of the attachments etc were sealed in their plastic cover packets. Quite loud. Reading the reviews i thought it would be less noisy, but its not. No blower  function other brands in this range have. Would have been great to have this. Only 3 attachments floor  carpet brush, multipurpose brush, crevice nozzle other brands in this range have many more. an extra filter would have been a good gesture to include. not very light. If one wants to clean high surfaces like sides of ceiling or ceiling fans etc, one needs to lift it and hold in hand while cleaning. Very difficult to do especially for ladies or at least me, a middleaged lady. Again, here the flexible hose if provided, would have been handy. Someone could  hold the vacuum cleaner while using the hose to clean high areas.All in all, reasonably happy with this purchase  as it is a supplementary one to my existing 35 year old Eureka Forbes vacuum cleaner which is still going strong, as the upholstery cleaning attachments for that model got lost.I do feel strongly though that the price could have been reduced considering all the above pros and cons.,Compact size,It is a light duty, light usage and a limited application area equipment. Not for effective  complete usage.,Its a good vaccum, good suction and easy to clean up. However the suction sound is quite loud. Nevertheless its a good machine. Does the job well.,The product works well. It just heats up after using for 15mins.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41IymCXFA7L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

The mic is also very good. Durability needs time to tell.

You have to buy a splitter if you want to use the mic on a mobile. What Ive noticed with other headsets is they provide a single jack for sound and mic output. But these come with 2 jacks so thats a plus point.Sound quality These pair of headphones are only recommended for casual gaming and media consumption, the sound quality while gaming is fine, although it doesnt have that 7.1 sound but still i was able to figure out the footsteps, i also use the windows sonic for headphones and that helps too.However, at this price dont expect a good sound quality if you listen to music. The max volume feels low and the bass is almost non existent. The treble, highs and lows are done fine but buy these pair only if your priority is gaming and you are at a budget.,See the headphones are good if u are purchasing in 500to 600 but let me tell u dont have good surround sound ,mic volume is too low you cant increase it and no bass,The Headset is overall good. Its sound quality and build quality is appreciated. At the same time, I have a few concerns, first of all, it gives a lot of pressure on both ears. So after an hour, it starts hurting.

It has total 3 pair or ear tips 2 in a zipper packet and 1 already attached to the earphone.  The manufacturing date is March 2022. So, its quite new actually, not an old stock. It also has that antislip ear hook, which is an added advantage. In general, it is a good product for this price.,I was looking for reliable Bluetooth earbuds on a budget, and settled on these. Personally, I am pleased with them. I have been using them for almost four months now, including one month when they saw around 12 hours of use per day.PROS Comfortable. Elegant and sober appearance. Reasonable battery life. I would let the earbuds recharge at, for example, mealtimes. Decent range. Going a few meters into the next room, with a concrete wall in between, was no issue. The battery status of the dock is shown by a series of LED blinks. Simple and practical.CONS Mediocre phone calling quality. In particular, the microphone. The few conversations I had using these went successfully, so this was not a deal breaker, but the clarity was not the best for sure.The touch controls were initially a drawback for me, but I got used to them. Also, this product does not come with a charger. Either charge off of your computer, or buy a charger with the recommended electrical output. As for the sound quality, it is acceptable, not superlative. I have listened to music, and I have watched films and YouTube videos, with no problem.As a final note, I prefer this type of earbud over the inear type, because I find it more hygienic. Wiping with a clean cloth after each use, and leaving the lid of the dock open for some time, should help to slow fungal growth.,Very Good Product, nicely fits in the ear and comfortable .The Volume seems to be a little low at the highest.But, A good Buy,Sound quality is good everything is balanced but bass dominance is too high and couldnt hear the treble and other notes,very good bass quality And Worth for money earphones I ever Buy.. also Product Quality is awesome ,it doesnt fit as snugly in my ears, maybe it is cause of greasy ears, but the product is good, highly recommended,,Bolte audio bass is very good",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31DbAD6EoCL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

I rated 4 because one of the protectors created a bubble at a specific area and didnt get out even after trying so hard and following all the instructions properly, and I had to use another one which got applied properly without creating any bubbles,,I ended up wasting one tempered glass because of air bubbles that wouldnt go away. I skipped wiping with micro fibre cloth which may have led to the problem. However the other glass worked fine, I had to take off my iPad cover to enable the application, the previous one wouldnt align with the cover in place. Adhesion of the first one gave up as soon as I tried to lift and reapply, again might be attributable to the fact that I didnt get rid of the dust particles like I should have.The one that I successfully applied, works just fine.,Good product. Decent alignment.,great product, theres no such anti glare thing, also not really good for using apple pencil, i mean the surface is not paper like thats why, one more thing it gets fingerprints really fastapplication is very easy but take care there is no dust on the ipad because if a bubbles formed you CANNOT correct it,Good,",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VIQVc-6XL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Uses almost half a unit for two person. And if you leave it on for the whole day its around 1 unit. Very power efficient. And looks stylish in the bathroom and due to the form factor doest take much space. Go for it . You get all the pipes and Installation material in the box so no need to buy them separately which is the case in some other models.,I had 2 option while purchasing this geyser, Havells vs this one. I opted this one as this was cheaper then its Havells counterpart but this geyser does not satisfies me at all. The only PROS is its heats up water very quickly but rest is all CONS.I keep the know to maximum temperature but still the light does not move from orange to red even if I put on the geyser for 3 hrs. It does not holds hot water for long. I have used Recold, AO Smith even Amica earlier they were not as quick as Crompton but they used to hold hot water for long. I have another Havells at home whose light goes from green to orange to red to display water temperature.,Paisa wasul hai,The product is not that good , just given 5 star energy efficient, but it takes more time to heat the water, also dont holds hot water for atleast 6 hrs.

So therr you have it folks, you can use this kettle for milk boiling and milk tea purpose.I found a little dent in the inner side on the base , but its minute only, so no worries, says a little about quality control. But its not a trade of really.And just as any other stainless steel utensils get stains at the bottom on boiling water, this one too.So my opinion, use soft water and avoid hard water.And ohh forgot to mention, there is a thermoplastic egg tray given with and easy carry stick, that you have to assemble.Overall a good buy,Nice product",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/414WPLTqm0L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

The coverage never dropped and was mostly consistent.However it suddenly developed some snag and stopped connecting to the internet. Apparently the Ethernet port got damaged somehow. I tried calling TP Link service center numbers and realised how bad their service is. Its the first time in my life that a router has broken and that too after just over a years usage. And to make it worse theres dismal after sales service.I tried to buy a replacement from tp link but that router came with problems as the connection wasnt stable. I think Ill finally look towards other router makers and avoid tplink product until maybe they start caring more for their costumers. Hopefully Ill find a good maker .,Good Router,After researching lot I settled on TP link A6,I was looking for better range router, this Router really worth the price. Dual band, guest wifi. I upgraded from tenda n301, and performance is really good.Range for 5Gz is not that good as 2.5Gz but which is accepted and no other routers in this range can provide better than this.,I was using Tenda AC 10 router since 2019 for 100Mbps connection from Local ISP Mach1 Broadband, Mumbai. Most of devices 5 Mobiles, 4 Laptops, 1 Firestick at my home work on 5Ghz except 1 CCTV camera. Range of Tenda AC 10 was good and used Digisol AC750 repeater for farthest room of my 2 BHK home.In recent lightning strike in Mumbai, power adapter of Tenda AC10 got burned out and performance issues creeped in with replacement adapter. I was searching for router with good range and speed within my budget. I tried 2 routers Mercusys AC1900 MR50G  TP Archer C80 AC1900 before this. Both Routers didnt meet my expectation. Range and speed of these 2 routers were poor than my earlier Tenda AC10. Amazon accepted returns without a single question. Thumbs up to Amazon.After some more research, I zeroed on TP link Archer A6  C6. As per comparison on TP link website both are identical routers. After doing some more research on blogs and reviews, I found that Archer A6 is the latest model and had slightly better processor both from Qualcomm. Hence purchased Archer A6. Feature of Onemesh is added advantage for adding onemesh repeaters in future. Separate Wifi SSID with same strength on both 2.4  5 Ghz as unnamed wifi can be seen on wifi analyser, as per TP link support page, this is dedicated wifi link for Onemesh repeaters.Now for router, Router is same as Tenda AC10 for coverage, it can not cover farthest room in 2BHK on 5Ghz. 2.4 Ghz band can cover 2BHK house, but speed is around 30 Mbps on 100 Mbps plan. However, speed on Archer A6 is better that Tenda AC10. Im getting 90 Mbps upload and download consistently on devices 515 feet apart in 5Ghz. TP Link Archer A6 is better than costlier AC1900 routers. Just for info, I received US version v2 of router instead of EU version mentioned on TP Link India website. Hence, firmware on TP Link India website will not match with device firmware. However, this device has auto update option directly from Internet. Also, router can be managed by TPLink Tether app remotely on internet even tough not connected on same wifi by login using TP link account on both router and Tether app.By trying so many routers, i understood that 5Ghz range will be week even with costliest router. Instead of using Digisol AC750 repeater, i installed my old Tenda AC10 in repeater mode for 5Ghz 2.4 Ghz disabled. Now my complete home is covered by 5Ghz signal. In the farthest room i receive download  upload speed of around 75 Mbps.I also tried old TP link Archer C50 which i had purchased when abroad, performance is not good in terms of speed and range as it lacks Gigabit ports, Beamforming  MUMIMO.My ISP has connected my link on Gigabit port of their switch in my society. However, cabling is only 2 pair CAT 5e which supports max 100 Mbps full duplex. I will try to get cabling changed to either 4 Pair CAT 5E or CAT6 from ISP and check the performance. I will update review after cabling change.So in the nutshell i would recommend to go for router with Gigabit ports, Beamforming  MUMIMO even if your internet speed is less than 100Mbps as it is future proof. TP Lnk Archer A6 is good router meeting all requirement within the budget.Hope this review is useful in search of good futureproof router.Edit 1My ISP tried to replace my connection to FTTH and this router was connected to Fiber ONU using Gigabit Port. It worked only for 15 mins. Max speed was 230 Mbps. ISP was not able to resolve the FTTH issue and changed cable to 4 Pair CAT5e, which supports Gigabit transmission. Now net speed is around 160 Mbps. My internet plan is 100 Mbps. Im happy with the speed. I have asked ISP to change my connection to FTTH at last. Tenda AC10 is now working as wired repeater connected on gigabit port of Archer A6 using CAT5e cable. Now complete home received stable wifi of 160 Mbps on 5Ghz band.I will update once again when FTTH connection is successful.,Good product till now 1 month,I am very Satisfied.,I am really satisfied with this product as earlier my phone is keep getting wifi disconnected and I used to reconnect it and the same way VPN  is keep getting reconnecting in my laptop hence my teams call used to disconnect during the meeting.. Now I am happy with this product where my vpn is not reconnecting even internet goes down and if any flatuations in the network as well.. Finally i am not seeing any issue with this router.. It is helping me during work from home ,Please go ahead,Its easy to use, easy to install , more function to control the router",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41VDUqScJFL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Calls getting disconnected  I had call with my brother last night and we talked for 50 min and call did not disconnect in the middle.2. Heating issue  While in day to day use never faced heating issue but It gets a little hot while charging, I can understand because of massive fast charging which is understandable. Every phone with fast charging heats a little.3. Camera Quality  It has a decent 64 mp Samsung camera module which is justified at price it comes. You can judge the camera based on how well it performs indoor with artificial lighting conditions and this has done good. Attached pic of cake which I clicked indoor only bright light source was candle. It performed well I can say.To people who complaint about camera   I just cannot expect picture clarity of Apple or Samsung high end devices, i have to set my expectations right for the price we have paid4. AnTuTu Benchmark Score  While company claim of 740000 while I tested i got a score of 700000 . I again cannot complaint here because I dont know what was the testing conditions and criteria that company had followed while testing. 700000 is pretty decent score I can say5. Phone lag  In two days of testing it has not lagged at all. With multiple background apps running.6. Battery Drain  Revisit few of the settings on your device, like animation, transition effect etc to get most out of your battery. If your batter is set of monstor mode set it to normal or battery saver to make most. Again battery depends of usage of individual and i cannot blame company. While I started to write this review my cell phone was at 100. Now its almost 25 min typing till now its now showing 99, i have set my screen at full brightness, i fell its decent. Also tested charging speed 0 to 50 in 12.03 min.7. Build quality  Its sturdy and decent plastic is used. I can say at this price point they should have provided glass build but again considering all price benefit you have got while buying this phone no complaint Card Discount  Exchange Benefit etc . Still I would take out 1 star here.8. Black colour issue  Did not face any problem with screen leak or black colour. Its AMOLED screen. Black is highlight of AMOLED. In case you were using IPS  FHD panel on your previous phone you will have trouble distinguishing. I have Samsung M51 as secondary device and i see black similar on both.9. BGMI  I played few rounds yesterday and did not face any frame drop or lag.10. Two year warranty  They calaimed to provide two year warranty on this device but during registration it shows only 1 year. I have personally wrote to Iqoo team and Amazon team seeking an answer, with screenshots waiting for answer.BTW majority of phone manufacturers provide 1 year warranty only, even iPhone. Here I would say fight for you justice and seek answer from Iqoo or Amazon Team.11. Video call lag  Did not face any, did multiple video calls yesterday with different people, did not get any complaint from them about my video lag. For all of them my video popped up instantaneous.Overall I would say I had a great buy and can recommend this device to others , for all the folks bombarding negative reviews, I would say first set your expectations right and you will be satisfied. In case even still you are facing problem then you have every right to complaint and get justice.Overall i give this device a 4 star as of now since I am yet to test this device long term like 3 months or 4 months.Please excuse any typos or grammatical errors if any. Entire review was typed on my phone Iqoo Neo 6.,I have been using a budget phone realme 3 since 2019 dynamic black, 3GB64GB. It served me well, but it was time for an upgrade. I was looking for a midrange model this time that would have almost everything I wanted within my budget. Did I get one Lets dig into it!THE GOOD Price. After discounts, I got a phone with practically all the features I wanted. IQOO is basically from Vivo, an internationally recognized brand. Hopefully, I dont have to worry about software updates for at least 3 years. IQOO is already doing good as I have received 3 security updates so far for the Android 12 that came out of the box. I will keep an eye on the security updates and OS upgrades as it will make me decide whether to go for VivoIQOO for my next phone. Dual 5G SIM support, which is futuristic. With 4G, the call quality has been superb so far. E4 AMOLED 120 Hz 1300 nits peak 1080x2400 pixels display with 60000001 contrast ratio, 360 Hz touch sampling rate and HDR10 Netflix HDR supported. A huge upgrade from my previous phone. The photos, OTT movies look too good. Easier to read contents like messages, emails or documents. 64 MP main cam with OIS. OIS was a musthave feature for me since I could be taking a lot of lowlight photos. 4700 mAh battery with 80W FlashCharge Technology 50 in 12 min, 100 in 32 min. Works as claimed. The battery life has been satisfactory. SD 870 CPU. Not one of the flagship processors today, but highly capable, and fantastic at this price. Inclusion of 12 GB RAM has made this phone a butterysmooth one for running apps Android is quite a RAM dependent OS unlike iOS. Up to 4 GB of phone storage can be used for extended RAM. Currently, I have 100 apps installed mostly productivity apps, but no gaming apps. The cascade cooling system seems to be working. 256 GB ROM with UFS 3.1. Since phones nowadays tend to ditch a dedicated microSDXC slot, and this phone is no exception, I did not want the 128 GB variant. A fast, large internal ROM is better than an external card as the latter loads the apps, files slower. The indisplay fingerprint reader works well. The stereo speakers are reasonably good. Infrared port IR blaster. I have not tried using it as a remote, but a must try. USBC port with USBC to USBA data cable that connects to the phone charger. Some of us prefer a USBC to USBC data cable instead as it is more friendly to the modern devices, but I can see why IQOO decided to provide a USBC to USBA. Most laptops still come with USBA ports even my recent hp 250 G8 laptop from the company I work for does have a USBC port without power delivery, and two USBA ports!. My powerbanks dont have USBC ports either. Screenshots, lock screen virtual buttons. Must as using physical buttons frequently for these functions can potentially damage the buttons.THE BAD Google backup. A FAIL. Since I did not have a USBC to USBC cable, I had to choose the WiFi data transfer option from my old phone to this one. Although I selected all the files, Google failed to transfer many files especially the PDFs. Dear Google, this is unacceptable. Spam handling. My realme 3 lets me block any SMS I want, but this one does not. In my opinion, every modern phone must have a native app that can identify the caller and help block a number or an SMS as needed. I have stopped using a 3rd party app like Truecaller, which has become a truly rogue app. No 3.5 mm jack a plus when you dont have a bluetooth earphone, or dont prefer one, but IQOO thankfully included a USBC to 3.5 mm adapter in the box. The absence of gorilla glass protection is not a good thing, but I do not mind as I barely drop my phone, and the phone came with an already applied tempered glass screen protector, and a transparent back cover. Really appreciated. The plastic body does not bother me moreover, the dark nova color feels cool. YMMV. In my realme 3 and not in my realme C2, which means it is a custom feature from realme for specific OS versions, if I try turning off the daily wakeup alarm, it gives me options like Turn off on the next day for which the alarm is active, Do not repeat any more, or Cancel. This is a fabulous feature as it allows me to turn off the alarm for a particular day say, an upcoming leave or holiday without turning it off for the following days! Unfortunately, this artificial intelligence is not available in my IQOO Neo 6 5G.Always buy a recently released model if you are going for an Android phone. This will make sure that you get software support for long enough time. Moreover, avoid buying the variant with lowest RAMROM. And, fast charging is a necessity as you see that you are hooked up with your phone all the time.I have used this phone for  2 months and will update this review as I keep using it. Till date, I am quite satisfied with IQOO Neo 6 5G I also liked the Funtouch OS, and recommend it to anybody who has needs like me.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DLLa8HNWL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

A little heavy but that could be because of upgraded species and battery from my last 5t. Solid built but it if its metal build then it will be more beautiful. Space fusion color is looking killer. Flash charger works awsome but charger design can be improved Display is crisp and clear but but in dark apps i.e, chrome, brave, linkdin etc youll notice a color change from Black to Greyish color that gives a cheap feel and I dont know if its a software or hardware issue.Actual Review While gaming Call of dutymobile has some lags and bugs and there is no option to block notificationcalls even after mute notification ONN everything is coming on screen and its very frustrating and annoying. Battlefield mobile ground, Asphalt 9, Clash of Clans, Battle Royale are working flowless. Some apps like Flipkart and Airtel gives some error screen zoom automatically while opening might be because of android 12 or something else. Now this is very weird that this phone reset a few setting automatically themselves when I dont want that. I dont want to set them everyday before using my phone i.e, I am using Bouncer to remove app permission when not in use and this phone remove accessibility setting even after batter optimization and background run.While listing to music I want paranomic 360 sound but it reset to default automatically. Gesture are not working fine, this can be fixed with future updates. I admit that funtouch OS has some more customization then Oxygen OS but it is missing some basic customization feature like I cannot change accent color, shape, size and the default one is looking very cheap must be because Oneplus oxygen OS is in my eyes but I am not overcome from oxygen OS, Oxygen Os is lub Funtouch OS is very uncomfortable for me for the first 45 days but now Im getting it a little. Less feature in gaming mode in comparison to Iqoo 7Camera Average as of now takes good picture in nightevening time and selfie camera is awsome. OIS works good as per the budget and gives value for money. Day time picture are good but something it changes the saturationcolor by itself automatically. No heat observed while gamingdoing heavy task minimal heat that every phone has now a days and it is 40c outside so this is not a big deal for me. Screen recorder and mic works awsome Crisp clear display except the issue I told above 67 SOT in one charge 0100 4244 minutes charging time 0100 No bugs lags observed till date 120Hz refresh rate made it monster Some preinstalled bloatware can be uninstall but some has to be force stop only or you can use Adb commande to remove permanently. A few apps are unnecessary like browser and a screen virus scan comes just after install an app from play store that very annoying and somehow I stopped that. Speaker volume is sufficient enoug loud in a roomConclusionIn 31k its worth for money with Snapdragon 888 processor and intelligent chip.Only thing that I dont like is funtoch os because it not gives a premium flagship phone experince.Has some bugs as of now i.e, In gaming mode, in a few apps, camera, Display that might fixed with future updates.Overall worth for money, And Yes you can pick it over Oneplus 9RT like I said youll probably feel bad for a week with its Funtoch Os but youll be okay with it after sometime.Just because of oxygen os spending 810k is not a great idea I think.,Camera quality is good , Video stability is awesome, processing and other functions are nice .  UI is not that good and battery life is not upto the mark,Pros Super fast app experience due to Snapdragon 888 Super fast charging good display but not comparable with Super Amoled of Samsung other phone Good large display size No heating in general use. Only seen when using camera video call but it cools down fast. Accessories given with the phone like Fast charger, USB c to 3.5 female adater, thin screen guard and translucent back cover. Ok cameraCons Display is not super amoled or vivid like Samsung A or S Series phone Battery drains fast Avg front camera Earth current can be felt when touching back camera while charging.,I was skeptical about the phone would perform as SD 888 has its own share of heating issues and all, but for 28k, this is one of the best phones in the segment.I had Pixel 6A and Nothing phone 1 as other options. Although their camera and software might be better in some aspects, the performance, the camera and gaming features this phone offers is incredible.Also Pixel and Nothing phone dosent give charger in the box so its a plus point.The only issue I faced is when I switch the phone to 60Hz. It starts to act as it lowers to 30,40 fps or something. And the battery life is average. Its 1 charge in the evening for sure. But decent battery coupled with a fast charger is more than enough.I use nova launcher with this and this solves the home screen style. Recommended to all.,Good display, good sound although sound is not much loud but have a sweet bass, smooth experience, camera good but front video could be given 60 fps, good haptic, every thing is good up to the mark but battery life could be better. Overall satisfied with the product.,They are ok, i can rate 2.55,Mobile is worth its money.,Idont use fingerprint and camera are very good battery life ok",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UwKwpK40L._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain .

There are no options to filter your choices based on the parameters that matter. It is easy to fall into the trap of an ongoing deal and end up buying something that falls short of what you need. In this review I will answer your questions about the PIGEON AMAZE PLUS 1.5L ELECTRIC KETTLE.1. Can I trust the reviews for this ad Are they genuineProbably yes. But know that the seller lists several types of PIGEON Kettles in the same ad. Unless the review refers to this particular model  you could well end up seeing a review of a product and buying a different one. The ratings are also an aggregated mix. There could be 10 negative review of the product you are seeing and 10 positives for the other products. The page will show you a neutral review. Thats the game sellers are playing these days  to avoid negative reviews. I have posted a picture of the stove I am referring to in this review.2. WATTAGE Important because this tells how quickly the water will heat up. This one is 1500W  meaning that you can switch it on ... brush your teeth and find the water is boiled. Great time saving !! My earlier one was 900W and it used to take 1015 minutes of patient waiting. The gas stove boiled water faster. This one takes about 34 mins to heat 2 mugs of coffee3. CABLE LENGTH Most of these kettle makers skimp on the cable length. I have purchased kettles to find they have only a 2foot long cable ... and I had to return them. This one has cable length of 22 slightly more than one meter  which is allows a comfortable distance between the kettle and the plug.4.  CONNECTOR  This one uses a 6A plug  which is most common in India. Be careful because from 1500W onwards, most kettles use a 16A plug and that is not always available at the place where you want to place the kettle. Strictly speaking, it should have a 16A plug, but then this is kept on for short intervals only.5.  CAPACITY  1.7 litres as mentioned  though I could not see markings for max and min levels. This is good enough to make 45 decent sized mugs of coffee6.  COOKING OTHER STUFF  The ad says only water  but I see no reason why you cannot heat Maggi etc. Maybe you can. But avoid milk as the expanding effect will cause spills and this can have adverse effects.7. LOOKS Quite okay for the price. It will not make your kitchen look bad  and neither will it enhance the looks. This is the most common look that an electric kettle can have.8. PERFORMANCE I have used for 2 days only. No complaints so far. There is a 1year guarantee card accompanying the product9. HANDLE Very convenient feel when you lift it it from the heating cradle. Does not feel very heavy even if there is a full 1.7L of water.10. NEGATIVES This is a steel jug. The outside will automatically heat up. If you are used to a plastic outside in your previous kettle, you need to be a little careful.VERDICT  BUYat the time of writing this review, this costs less than Rs 700. I have seen that sellers tend to inflate prices as they get my positive reviews  therefore I am also mentioning the price range based on which I gave this product a 5 star review,The body is very lightweight and doesnt feel sturdy. Does the job of heating water fast and thats it. Cord length could be a little longer. The plastic parts doesnt feels sturdy. The top cap has a smaller dia so a mans hand has a trouble fitting it inside the container during cleaning and can easily cut our hands. Overall its okay.,Its quality was not too much good, light quality product but according to price its okay.Easy to use product  good for save time.,Good product for boiling water. shock proof. So no worries.hahaha,Cattle bass fitting not currently,Good product,Go for it,Amazing  product.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31na34LxwmL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg
"AGARO Esteem Multi Kettle 1.2 Litre, 600W with 3 Heating Modes  Rapid Boil Technology","Multiple usage- Boil Water, prepare eggs, tea, noodles, etc.;Capacity: 1.2 Litres, 600 Watts|3 Heating Modes- Boiling, Heating & Keeping Warm;Easy to clean wide mouth|Transparent glass lid for superior cooking;Accessories: Stainless Steel Grill, Egg Boiler Rack, Plastic Bowl|360 degree swivel detachable power base|Size Name: 1.2 Liter; Color Name: Black","600 W heating kettle with warmer  temp control, half coil heating element looks odd,Overall a Good Electric Kettle,Overall good.,Good Multicooker within budget,Agaro esteem Multi kettle,Quality,Very nice product. Like it.,Nice one for hostellers. A must buy product.","1. I have used it mainly for boiling water knob turned maximum to right so cannot comment much about lower temperature settings.2. It takes about 10 min for water to boil.3. Suggest Mfr to release in other colour like light blue etc as I see some other kettles .  It may add to the looks and give a warm feeling in the room.4. The stainless steel looks shiny but the material is not very thick but its ok for the price.  There may be formation of scaling or white brownish spots on the base of kettle in a C shape due to the C shaped half coil at base funny design, maybe a product created by modifying a higher wattage full circular coil kettle.  The scales are more when tap water is used due to higher presence of salts maybe.  They seem to get cleaned by usual scrubbing.5. Given wide based cylinder shape, it is very easy to clean.To be aware The kettle does not autoshut off when water boils.  Similarly, the kettle temperature will be kept warm at knob setting unless the knob is at the leftmost when it shuts off.  Else the water will keep drying out until it dries out completely and then the kettle is supposed to auto shut off to prevent dry heating I havent tested this though.  These are mentioned in the manual.  So this can be thought of as a warmer  boiler.  So you CANNOT leave the kettle unattended thinking that it will auto shut off like other kettles when the water has started to boil.  I assume this is designed this way to allow a bit of cooking for those who want to use it in that manner.Accessories Cannot fathom what the use is of the plastic bowl provided.  Given that plastics can leach chemicals when heated, I would not suggest to use it inside the kettle in any way, e.g. steaming.  A steel rack is given, too.  That could be used alongwith some steel plate with holes for steam cooking but there is none provided with the product itself.Final verdict If you are ok with a somewhat slower heating kettle but with more versatility and easy to clean at a reasonable price, this will do the job.  If a similar product was available with higher wattage at a higher price, I would have bought that instead.,I wanted to give 1 star rating because Agaro forces its customers to give rating and review to get the warranty. It is a bad practice. You cannot force customer to give rating. As I mentioned, it may result in the product having negative rating on Amazon despite being a good product.In my opinion the product itself is good. It heats water very fast. It is good for making Maggie, pasta, and boiling eggs. But need to be careful while making Maggie or pasta because once they get dry they start to stick to the bottom.The kettle is very easy to clean.The cord length should have been longer.One issue that I noticed that only one half of the base of kettle generates heat.,Everything is good  it has been very useful for me. There is only one drawback I guess the heating is not uniform across the base of the kettle since whenever I boil milk or make teacoffee, a portion of one side bunrs the milk. Even while boiling water I can see the similar symptom.,Agaro Multicooker is good and gives a variety of cooking boiling options like Milk, Tea, Eggs, Maggi, etc.Only negative point is that Agaro team promises extended warranty of 6 months by giving asking to give a positive review on Amazon but fails to deliver on their promise and does not give any extended warranty.,Delivery has safe got item safely.Delivery on time, instantaneous water boiling sufficient space big volume best for hostel students.Hope for warranty and company response.,I liked how fast it does the work but i hate about the dirt it gets inside after cooking something, it sticks their,Overall gorgeous product. The most beautiful thing is that the cord length is big. That is a better option for your kitchen and aslo that is the best option for hostel users.,Liked the design and operation. However cord length could be longer. Temperature control is good but knob need some modifications. Overall happy with this product.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NW-vJum5L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Yes, the steam is somewhat better than Philips as the user has used Philips also but as compared it should have been price competitive.Well  yes, it is able to remove crease from Jeans and even TShirt.We prefer stiff shirts for office wear so no good for Formals or Casual Shirts neither that good for pants.The water filler should have been round shape being a conical shape it does not give idea as to what level the water has been filled.Based on the water container it can steam 2 to 3 clothes at a time. Also, after 2 to 3 clothes the hand get pain. So, you cannot steam more garments.Also, you need some kind of support at the back  just hanging on the Hanger is not enough. The Manufacturer should have given a though on this and could have added an accessory either free of cost or at additional charge.Well so  If I get more information I will update, and change based on the same.,Good not best,I like the product but the only drawback i found isA according to the water capacity tank, in just about 5 min of usage you have to refill. So that way for each cloth you have to refill the tank.B its quite heavy. So i dont recommend this for long use. If you want to steam 12 clothes than its fine. Also the cloth must not be hung up above your height other wise it will be painful for you to hold this heavy steamer above causing more pain .My tip is that place the steamer on a table  after pressing on the steam button once the steam gets coming out you can hold your clothes  swiftly move in front of the steam 2 inches away that way you will save yourself from the pain of holding it. Also pls use a plastic hanger  never steam over a metal surface , is a nice product but only reason I gave 4 star is that it becomes too heavy when it is held with water filled in the bottle.,Its only 2 days we used this product. However its awsome and really a great worker when it comes to ironing. Its effortless and very quick.,If you want to purchase a steamer, go for it. It weights around 850gm without 250ml water, so the only concern is weight and how long u can hold it in your hand during steaming process. Otherwise performance wise this is by far the best machine available. Quality and finishing of the product are also very good. Certainly recommended.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41CsMm+ZCgL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

However, for now, the company has taken on wireless headphones in an affordable form  neckbandstyle earphones. The headset has a flexible neckband with metal modules at the ends, short cables that lead to the earbuds, and the plastic earbuds themselves. We quite liked the yellowandblack colour scheme of our review unit. The design is simple and the build quality is decent. The device is light at just 30g, and comfortable to wear and use for long hours at a stretch.Like earlier Realme earphones, the Realme Buds Wireless have magnets in each earbud. While they dont serve any purpose on the wired models beyond keeping the two earbuds together, the magnetic clamp serves as the power switch for the Realme Buds Wireless. Separating the buds turns the headset on, while attaching them powers it down there is no power button, so this is the only way to control power on the headset.In theory this sounds good, but the weak magnets meant that the earphones separated easily when placed in a bag or pocket. This would turn the earphones on and automatically connect with our paired smartphone even when we didnt want it to, which was bothersome. Calls would be automatically diverted away from the smartphones earpiece without us knowing, the battery would run down, and the phone wouldnt automatically connect to other devices such as a Bluetooth car audio system.What you do get in the sales package are three pairs of silicone ear tips, ear wings that are preattached to the earbuds, and a MicroUSB cable for charging. The charging port is on the underside of the right module, which also has the controls for playback, calls, and volume.The Realme Buds Wireless earphones are powered by 11.2mm drivers, with Bluetooth 5 and support for the SBC and AAC codecs. The earphones have a claimed battery life of 12 hours on a single charge, and are said to offer 100 minutes of listening time on a 10minute charge when the battery is drained. We were able to get around 9 hours of use in our testing, while a full charge of the headset took a little under 3 hours to complete.  Realme Buds Wireless performanceThe Realme Buds Wireless bring a refreshing change to the budget segment, offering a great combination of design and sound quality for the price. Also, fans of electronic music will be happy to know that the Realme Buds Wireless have been tuned with inputs from popular DJ Alan Walker, and the sound does come across as geared for this genre. the wireless earphones with use AAC Bluetooth codecs. We listened to streamed music from Spotify and YouTube Music, as well as our collection of highresolution tracks.Starting with Take Five by the Dave Brubeck Quartet, we immediately noticed that the soundstage was considerably wider and more detailed than what were typically used to hearing from products in this price range. Some of the percussion instruments sounded crisp and well defined, although the deeper elements in the middle of the track  the doublebass, in particular  was a bit soft and not quite as distinct as wed have liked. Still, we found the sound to be detailed and rich on the whole.Next, we listened to a bit of Indian pop with an Unplugged rendition of Amar Arshis Kala Chasma. Apart from some gentle aggression in the low end, we also quite liked the inoffensive nature of the mids and highs, as demonstrated with the familiar vocals of the track. The sound of the Realme Buds Wireless is tuned for comfort and nearuniversal appeal, and sticks to that brief. We heard just about as much detail and clarity as we could have hoped for from a pair of wireless earphones that cost less than Rs. 2,000.the Realme Buds Wireless as a handsfree headset for voice calls, and results were mixed. In some cases we found that voices on the other end of the call were soft, and our callers reported too much background noise  a crow cawing about 20 feet away sounded as if it was coming from right next to us, for the person on the other end. On other occasions, no issues were reported, so call quality seems to be largely dependent on your surroundings and possibly the strength of your cellular signal.  VerdictMore expensive pairs of earphones such as the OnePlus Bullets Wireless 2 and 1More Stylish Dual Dynamic Driver might offer much more by way of sound quality, but the Realme Buds Wireless does a capable job for just Rs. 1,799. This is a product worth considering simply because it is everything you need for the price.This headset is built well, has decent battery life, and is very comfortable to wear. The only significant problem for us was the magnetic power switch, which often led to the earphones automatically powering on at awkward times. That aside, the Realme Buds Wireless is a pair of earphones that does exactly what its supposed to  no more and no less  with unwavering consistency, and we like it for that.Pros1  Looks good2  Light and comfortable3  Detailed, rich sound for the priceCons1  Magnetic power switch is troublesome2  Inconsistent performance on voice callsRatings out of 5Design comfort 4.0Audio quality 3.8Battery life 4.5Value for money 4.8Overall 4.0Go and purchased,First of all if you are a ElectronicDance and HipHop Genre kind of enthusiast than your search for a good quality earphone STILL CONTINUES, its not like these earphones are worthless for these genres and cannot be listened on these, surely you can listen and enjoy it but you just could not get the vibes you get while listening those on deep base earphones.From My music listening experience from 8 Years i can tell you that the Depth and that vibrating Surround base effect is not in this  it surely has some thumpy bass which is required for perfect balance in every genre but due to lack of that deep base you will definitely regret your purchase if youre a HipHop EDM lover THE MID TONES OF MUSIC ARE A LITTLE LOW IN THIS EARPHONE WHICH ALSO RUINS A LITTLE THE EXPERIENCE OF THESE GENRES SONG LISTENING EXPERIENCE.THIS WANNA MAKES ME THINK EVERYTIME IS ALAN WALKER REALLY TUNED THISFOR TRAP  HARD DANCE GENRE ITS GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST.I can tell you such differences because I am also using a wired earphone namely MI Earphones PRO 1799 rs which is excellent and produces very great sound for every genre and definitely have that deep base effect!!RATHER THAN FOR THOSE GENRES SONG THESE EARPHONES ARE REALLY GOOD FOR EVERY OTHER GENRES !!!If Youre Fine with the above listed drawbacks Then only head towards the detailed review!!UPSIDES1. THE MATERIAL QUALITY IS GOOD, ITS PLASTIC BUT FEELS LIKE A SOFT SILICON LAYER IS APPLIED OVER ITS TOP LAYER BOTH ON THE NECKBAND AS WELL AS THE WIRES OF THE EARPLUGS.2. THESE ARE EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT AND DOESNT FEELS A LIKE EXTRA LOAD ON YOUR NECK AT ALL.3. NOISE CANCELLATION IS REALLY VERY GOOD, IM REALLY IMPRESSED.4. MIC QUALITY IS ALSO THE BEST THAT CAN BE OFFERED IN 2000 RANGE No Complaints5. THE EARPLUGS FIT IS GOOD BUT I ADVICE YOU TO REMOVE THOSE REMOVABLE ANGULAR PADDINGS FOR MORE SNUG FIT AND COMFORT IS FINE BUT COULD BE MORE BETTER AS MY WIRED ONES ARE REALLY MORE COMFORTABLE AND IF YOU HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THIS, THEN YOU CAN ALSO COMPLAIN ABOUT ITS COMFORT FOR LONG USE.6. THE BLUTOOTH RANGE IS REALLY GOOD STILL WORKS IF 2 ROOMS ARE IN BETWEEN7. THE MAGNETIC ONOFF CONTROL IS LIKE CHERRY ON CAKE AND WORKS LIKE CHARM!WHEN YOU SEPERATE THEM IT TAKES 34 SECONDS TO CONNECT WITH YOUR PHONE IF ALREADY PAIRED BEFORE AND IF PHONES BT IS ON, AND IF YOU ATTACH THEM TOGETHER THEY GO TO STANDBY MODE AND GOES OFF IF NOT OPENED AGAIN WITHIN 5 MINUTES, ITS REALLY GOOD THAT YOURE GETTING THIS MAGNETICFUNCTION IN THIS PRICE!!8. SOUND CAN GO REALLY LOUD BUT I PREFER TO USE IT ON 6070 9. MICRO USB CABLE  2 PAIR OF EXTRA EARTIPS SMALL  LARGE ARE PROVIDED IN BOX MEDIUM IS PREAPPLIED AND IS PERFECT NEARLY FOR EVERYONE10. BATTERY BACKUP IS GOOD EXPECT 8 HOURS OF CONTINUOS PLAYBACK ON 70 VOLUME11. CHARGING SPEED IS ALSO GOOD, YOU CAN EASILY GET 1 HOUR OF PLAYBACK ON 1O MINUTES OF CHARGE!, AND CAN FULLY CHARGE IT AROUND 90100 MINUTES IF FULLY EMPTY.12. DID NOT GET TO EXPERIENCE ITS SPLASH RETENTION PROPERTY.DOWNSIDES1. THE OUTER COVER OF EARPHONES ARE OF PLASTIC GOOD QUALITY, BUT THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALUMINIUM FRAME IN THIS PRICE.2. THE WIRES SHOULD ALSO BE GIVEN AS BRAIDED ONE FOR ROUGH AND LONG USE3. NO REALME BRANDING PERMANENT ANYWHERE ON THE EARPHONE CONFUSES US, BUT THERES TAG ATTACHED ON THE NECKBAND4. THE CAP ON THE CHARGING PORT SHOULD HAVE GIVEN TO PREVENT DUST FROM ENTERING.5. SMALL CARRY CASE OR POUCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO MAKE IT TRAVEL FRIENDLY6. WHEN CONNECTED TO THE DEVICE WHEN THERE IS AN INCOMING CALL IT DOESNT RECITES THE NUMBER OF CALLER, AND IT SOMETIMES DOESNT NOTIFIES AT ALL... BUT NO MAJOR CON IS THERESOUND QUALITY1. THE VOCALS ARE REALLY AMAZING  NOW I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE LYRICS OF POP SONGS .2. THE LOWS AND HIGHS OF THE SONGS ARE REALLY GREAT BUT MIDS ARE LITTLE SUPRESSED AND YOU WOULD DEFINITELY MISS THAT IN EDM AND HIPHOP SONGS as that evary low details are not required in dance songs, the Mids  Highs are more important3. THE BASE IS ADEQUATE AND KEEPS THE SONG ALIVE BUT NOT PRODUCES THAT WELL DEEP AND SURROUND BASE THAT YOUNGSTERS LOVE, BUT IT DEFINITELY HAS THAT AMOUNT OF BASE REQUIRED IN ANY SONG TO FEEL IT, IM ALSO A YOUNSTER AND IM FINE WITH IT AS IVE BOUGHT IT AS A SECONDARY EARPHONE FOR WATCHING MOVIES AND SERIES ON TV SILENTLY WITHOUT DISTURBING MY FAMILY SO THIS FULFILLS MY PURPOSE.4. THE BEAT AND SOUND PRODUCED FEELS NATURAL AND CLEAR LIKE HIGH QUALITY HEADPHONES AND IN THIS RESPECT ALAN WALKER AND REALME TEAM HAD SURELY DONE A GREAT WORK.5. BASED ON TYPES OF MUSIC LOVERS I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO POP, INDIEPOP, ACOUSTIC, RB, Rock and soft Rock, TRAPHARD DANCE  NEARLY ALL KINDS OF GENRES EXCEPT EDM AND HIPHOP...AS IVE BOUGHT IT AS A SECONDARY EARPHONE SO I DO NOT HAD ANY GREAT EXPECTATIONS AND I CAN SURELY SAY THAT IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS AND IM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE....PLEASE READ THE WHOLE REVIEW IT WILL SURELY HELP YOU DECIDE MORE CLEARLY.HAVE A GOOD PURCHASING EXPERIENCE, THAKYOU FOR READING!!!,Best but little high price.6to 12 month daily use he chal pata h ..,The base is so loud. you cant listen for long, you will get ear pain after 1 hour.

Night mode is good as well.Only flaw i feel is that the head portion is bulky while its resting stand is not heavy leading to the camera movements if not screwd down.,Best camera impressed me video quality is osome but the app lags,I like it,It is a very compact product that can fit almost anywhere. The only drawback is that most of the features that it offers are cloud based and requires you to pay to avail them.Features like rich notification, where the phone notifications also contain a screenshot when the motion is detected, should have been included as part of free service at least when connected to the same wifi. As of now, the only free notification that you get is an alert with the date and time the motion was detected and you need to open the app and wait for it to load up before knowing what motion had occured.AI motion detection also should have been a locally available free feature instead of relying on cloud. The normal motion detection is not very perfect and has few false positives.Also, a web UI would have been nice to have instead of relying only on the Tapo app to view and configure the settings.Overall, as a normal ip camera with recording, this is great but most features that it provides requires paid cloud connectivity which was disappointing and it lacks a web UI. Hence,I would recommend that you check other brands before deciding to buy this.,Very good for small shops or indoor for house care,It was definitely not a new sealed product. It looked like a returned product resold to me...it was dusty inside, original stickering worn out etc..  but the product works n i am ok with it.,,Tapo cam is very good and working as expected and 32gb sd card can record upto 3 days and continue in loop mode.

If not for that this product would have had real good rating. I received a slightly defective piece where indicators where not working. I initially raised an issue about it but there was no immediate support for that. As filter was working fine and we didnt require indicators, we didnt bother to follow up. After several days the service guy came and fixed it. First time when the service guy came there was no one. So he came again and got it fixed. For immediate support, its better to reach out to local authorised dealer or service , as going through the official support delays the process. So considering all these I feel product is decent.,Free services are limited. If we change the filter during the free services, we will be charged.

Previously i done a service with the company servicemen he put a cap on the nozzle of the water pump so it stopped working and it all damaged.

It serves these purpose very well and is not pricey. Why I am saying all thisFirst things first, I got this at 549 the black one only as rest of the colors were way too pricey and choice of colors can be sacrificed in such a case. 2. My laptop and phone volume  is too low and watching a video or listening to music on these devices is not a good experience. So here too this speaker served the purpose as connectivity is excellent, size of speaker is conveniently small, lightweight and battery backup is damm awesome. After a complete charge I used this speaker for continuously for about 6 hours at about 80 volume and still the speaker is left with 60 charge. I cannot comment right now for the charging time as it arrived with more than 70 charge and I just topped it to full. Bluetooth connectivity is exceptionally good upto 10 mtrs. FM reception is average without connecting the datacharging cable but it is awesome if the cable is connected. It has only four buttons and all the functions are controlled by these buttons only. First button M is mode which when pressed switches from Bluetooth to FM to Aux to Usbmemory card. Transition of switching is flawless. Volume updown keys are used to change volume and switch the channels. Long press changes the volume and short pressclick changes the channels in FM or changes the track via Aux. Most usefull feature of this speaker is its mic. Yes, you can actually use this speaker when connected to phone to talk with someone and that too with no connectivity issues. Voice clarity is very good for the calls made. MUSIC CLARITY IS NOT VERY GOOD. READ CONS FOR THIS. Quality of the plastics used seems good and feels durable.CONS. Sound quality is just average.  Voice call clarity is very good where music is not dominant. But when it comes to music, this speaker struggles to deliver quality. People are complaining in reviews that it doesnot produce any bass, but actually its is the bass produced by the speaker which deteriorates the quality. This is understandable for this product as it just has one tiny speaker inside and if manufacturer makes it to produce some bass will definitely deteriorate the music quality. But this is manageable and you can ADJUST THE MUSIC EQUALIZERS in your laptop or phone to get pretty decent music quality. This is the reason I dont consider its music quality a con for the product. Theres one limitation about charging connector to. It comes with a charging port compatible to AB type connector, so if you have a charger with data cable supporting C type connectors, you are bound to use the charging cable supplied with speaker only. So you cannot keep just one common cable with you to charge both your phone and speaker. Instead you will have to carry two different cables. This speaker does not come with a charger, so you will have to use your mobiles charger 5v, 1A  for the purpose. But for the price rage, this seems reasonable.Useful tip for buyers Most of the smart phones will display battery percentage left in the speaker. But you can install any of these two apps Bluebatt or Bluetooth check ringtone and show battery level from the playstore, if in case your phone is unable to fetch battery data from speaker.What you get in complete package 1 unit of Bluetooth speaker, 1 cable which has Aux connector, USB connector and AB type micro Usb connector, 1 tiny  user manual.Quality of packaging Excellent, sturdy,  packaging used by Cloudtail to secure the companys product packaging. Manufacturing date was of May2021.,I like it,Portability and Bluetooth connection is good.,Awesome ",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41goRo3UXhL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

This adjustment 5mm clearance was achieved measuring with calibrated stand alone  CO2 cum PM 1.0, 2.5 , 10 measurement meterOne more example with above ventilation arrangement, the machine is in auto and ambient air pm2.5 at 198ppm, room also at 198 ppm,  the  fan speed reached  medium sound audible, it took some time to reach  85ppm  and then it took  1min from 85 ppm to  68 ppm,  now fan speed changed to low speed in Auto sound is inaudible, this ppm  starts increasing gradually to 85ppm  in 1.5 minutes, now fan speed increases to medium again and the cycle repeats as long as outside pm 2.5 is 198ppm.Similarly the fan speed so its sound can be very high if ambient pollution is very high.It needs external cleaning of its HEPA filter every month based on pollution. The sensor may need cleaning every 3 months for accurate readings if sensor mal functions , it is to be cleaned first and check  before taking to any service center.It has a simple filter element with spare availability and capable to give atleast 3 times the specified life, if we clean the HEPA filter element externally with vacuum cleaner regularly.It does not have ozone producing UV rays or ion generators, which if not properly designed  specified to customes not worry  may pollute the air with ozone.It has particulate count PM 2.5 meter which is very accurate,  in addition it change display colour according to pollution zones to know the condition of air in the room The readings were authenticated with above calibrated stand alone meter  CO2, PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10.We have to keep it on Auto to facilitate to change flow speed based on pollution level itstemperature and humidity meters  are also useful.Update 24.04.22 still under warranty  It developed some abnormal sound just audible , when we go near to it like kitch, kitch, kitch.. at lowest speed. Doubt was on loosening of bottom locknut of fan and sound is ruled out from fan bearings, this diagnosis also strengthened by the observation that the above sound disappeared, when it is made upside down.Bottom cover opened , side covers opened , the bottom grill was moved down by lifting lock with columns and it was found that the button lock nut was in  slightly loose condition as anticipated. The abnormal sound and mild vibration problems are resolved after tightening the nut with 13mm tubular spanner already available with me,  holding the fan  nut is a  self locking type and assembled back ,  But opening of side covers is a tricky and risky job some locks may be broken, use hand gloves to protect hands from sharp edges , they may open in jerky motion . I have made some top grill locks bottom side open by cutting modification  so that I can open the panels easily in future. However another Mi Air purifier 2S is working almost continuously without any problem from last 3 years.Update 02.07.22 High abnormal sound observed. This time I want send it to service center , but while lifting some material flied off from grill. So, when I run it upside down many foreign material came out like some bodies of flying ants , their wings and one baby lizard. Now again it is working normal.,Actualy ther is no need of any smart features for an air filter. in practicality we just plug and use it. Yes air quality is improving. But it does not reduce any Allergic issues.,Really liked the product, i like how it shows the current AQI, has a auto mode, night mode that is super helpful with a baby,The air purifier is 45  is quiet, filters well and quickly. Will wait and watch for long term reliability, plus the replacement filters are expensiveBut the seller shipped an item in an open box, turned out to be a used product. Filter says 90 remaining, meaning it had been used to a good extent earlier. Not sure why second hand items are sold as new,WORKS WELL SINCE 5 MONTHS. MORE COMMENTS WILL BE UPDATED SOONER.,I like because the performance is good and effective very easy to install,It works well but pollution level indicator is not reliable and keeps changing number very quickly in vide range so in night you cant use night mode",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41Mktp5hVIL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

It is a good thing as it prevents damage to the storage component, hence increasing lifespan, but at the cost of speeds. But after 33mpbs, it further drops down to 20, then 13 and becomes stable there. Here its just too slow for heavy everyday use like transferring videos for editing. Room temp 24C, your milage may vary with different types of files, computers and portsBut for the vast majority of users, who just use it as a backup, or for once in a while storage, or for regularly working with small files like pots and photos, its perfectly fine. Its fast, makes it convenient to transfer files between phones and laptops and desktops, because of its versatile setup of a changeable usb c and a setup. It feels strong and durable, even through its made if plastic.For the price of 719rs for the 64gb variant it is not very affordable. A regular usb a penflash drive and a type a to c adapter combination as illustrated above, available for about rs 130 as of writing this review, and a 64GB flash drive costing anywhere between 400 and 550rs as of writing this review will cost less. But a regular usb drive and the combo will not be as convenient and fast, but again its not required for most people not to mention that the adapter is quite useful elsewhere as well but for the small niche of users who want speed and have small files below 1.5GB at a time to work with, its recommend.Otherwise going with the luxe for performance or the adapter setup better value for money as mentioned above will be a better decision.Hope you find this effort helpful,It would be better if the holder of pendrive is strong enough.And its very hard to insert into my type c mobile lgg8x.I got bit scared thinking of it will get broken.Better to buy this in offer the price gets less than I bought.

But it didnt clearly suit the Samsung monitor I have. I had to remove a specific part behind the monitor and adjusted this wall mount. Till now no issue.,Product is good. I am using Benq ex2780q monitor. Holds well enough but there are only 2 places to screw it in. This makes you doubt sometimes weather this can hold up the weight of the monitor. I have been using it for the past 2 months and havent faced any issue.Another problem with this montioe is the rubber that is used for rotating the montioe is cheap and gets broken initially only. But replaced with proper nuts and this worked fine for meFinal verdict good monitor wall mount easily taking 5kg of weight on it.Could have been better if the rubber material and count of screw holes in the wall mount be more,Great product at reasonable rate. Very easy to install. Very sturdy product. Never feel like monitor will fall down.,Self install a bit difficult. The plate connecting to monitor could have been removable and drop in clamp .

The review is for Sennheiser 275 S earphone but items for comparison are1. Sennheiser HD 202 II over the ear headphone ,2. Sennheiser CX 275 S In earphone3. Sony MDRXB50AP in ear Extra Bass earphones  Just for an introduction i would like to mention, I am a dire fan for flagship Electronic goods  manages to fulfill my passion for the Taste of quality from time to time. Now lets begin.. When you start looking for earphones or headphones, Sennheiser is definitely a brand worth to look for and rightly so, The brand has acquired a great reputation of producing some top notch quality gears in its segment .I too ,started my quest to purchase some of the best sounding earphones within reasonable limits of purchasing power  excluding those insanely pricey ones.Read some very good reviews of the Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional OverEar Headphone from my fellow amazonians and bought it.Found it to be reasonably good but having certain drawbacks may refer my review of HD202 at amazon which were not upto my taste.Next ,Unsettled , I went to purchase these Sennheiiser CX 275 S in earphones and here are my observationsDESIGN   CONSTRUCTION a. Looks  feels delicate to hold with its extremely thin wires and if you are casual in handling frequently, then in the long run,its sure to fail.b. Wires which are around 1.2 m in expanse are not tangle free and keep getting into random knots each time you get to use it.c. Comes with 3 different sized earpieces to snug fit different earanatomies and provides decent sound isolation but not the best.d. Inconvincing design of the earpiece globes as the bottom tail piece below the earpiece was not large enough to grip with fingers to comfortably fit or adjust the earpieces in the ears and each time you had to twist the spherical globes to snug fit.e. Comes with a gold plated Lshaped additional adapter for better fitment to laptops etcf. Comes with a small pouch , which for the most part was a useless accessory for me. A case or box would have been more a more elegant option. Squeezing the whole earphone into the lill pouch everytime..naah !! feels primitive..! but then its my own two pieces.SOUND QUALITY  PERFORMANCExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe sound quality is crisp  clear , with clear mids and crisp pitches, bass was okayish but leaves you craving for more every time you plug itin to watch some movie or NATGEO documentaries.The lack of an adequate bass may even get unsettling sometimes.The frequency response as per specs was 17 to 23000 Hz against 4 to 24000 Hz of Sony MDRXB50AP.Just to quote Sonys bass could get really deep  low with its 12mm drivers and neodymium magnets. For purists senneheiser does its job quite honestly but in general as for sony A little makeup wont Hurt   LOL.Sound quality is maintained till the maximum volume though it felt slightly that the mids succumbed to pitches at the apex.VERDICT xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Lack of a decent bass  extremely fragile design is unacceptable at a price range of 1600 bucks For me Not worth it.DETAILS  COMPARISON xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI happened to test the quality  performance of all the 3 renowned Sennheiser HD 202 II over the ear headphone, Sennheiser CX 275 S In earphone  lastly Sony MDRXB50AP in ear Extra Bass earphones.BASS xxxxxxxxxxxxxxSonySenn.HD 202  Senn.CX 275S ,The extra bass at sony may feel out of place at rare instances but never feels Cheap, redundant or unpleasant to the ears. Its a quality refined timbre  bass  not some low quality stuff. HD 202 bass was ok but then it had other issues with sound leaking from the pads and disturbing others.SOUND QUALITY xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxExcellent on all 3 but Sony a bit appealing with its  phenomenal immersive bass.BUILD  DESIGN xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Again SonySenn.HD 202  Senn.CX 275S .Sonys wire were tangle free, earphone pieces felt indestructible, noise isolation was Ultimate.Next was Senn.HD 202 and least by any standards was Senn.CX 275S.The fragile design of the wires around Mic. In senn.CX 275 may itself be a let alone discarding feature for many.1. Senn.HD 202 II might be good for gamers and watching from a distance with its long cord if leaking sound to outside world is not an issue.Bass is anytime better than Senn.CX 275 S but not as mesmerising as Sony.Sound quality though is very good,crisp and clear.2. Senn.CX 275 S might be good for purists but even with its balanced Highs and mids..Serious lack of bass keeps you longing for more ..especially if you are more into movies,games and documentaries than music.Moreover its extremely fragile  always tangling thin wires  is a constant annoying feature.3. Sony MDR XB50AP gets the most evident and refined high quality deep bass with crisp high and quality mids.Its indestructible unique design offers the best noise isolation of all and comes with the most sturdy tangle free wires.Do not consider higher bass as an adulteration to pure music.Its a quality bass with frequency response as low as 4 to 24000 Hz.adds a mesmerizing essence to the quality of sound which is absent on other two.Probably like a Super amoled with extra vivid colors that look more punchy  full of life.Anyways at the end of the day its your call.keep listening.,NOTE There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly theres hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market. I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review. You get a  L  shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,BUILT QUALITY  boAt  Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 56 months. Perfect L shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting. JBL  Small round cables, shredding off after 78 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.Connector is bent, but not in perfect L shape, so its quite pain to use while resting. Sennheiser  Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect L shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting. WINNER boAt 225 COMFORT  boAt  comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head. JBL  Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening. Sennheisers  Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage. WINNER  sennheisers cx180 LOUDNESS CX180  boAt 225  JBL CS100SI boAt  tends to distort above 75 level of volume. JBL  Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three. Sennheisers  tends to distort above 75 level of volume, but has greater sound level of all. WINNER  sennheisers cx180 SOUND QUALITY  Bass, mids  lows  I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids  lows, which are strong  Crisp. But bass levels are different. boAt  has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads. JBL  has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these. Sennheisers  ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers. WINNER  sennheisers cx180 SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL  boAt  I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 56 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side. JBL  its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now. Sennheisers  their NO microphone, lol PNOTE boAt  JBL boths mics works with android and iOS perfectly. WINNER  boAt 225 CUSTOMER CARE  boAt  1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didnt got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences. JBL  1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center. Sennheisers  2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.NOTE I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all. WINNER  sennheiser cx180 CONNECTIVITY All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.VERDICT I dont think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31VnhITYb+L._SY300_SX300_.jpg

I got it installed Stand mount as wall mount not freely providing.Technician somehow explained TV usage but thinking as not MI person not have full knowledge and exploring and telling each details.However, normal usage of TV, this amazon technician help is fine.TV ExperienceFirst day Having slight less picture quality and few showing pixels not as required for Eye safeness.After 3 or 4 days Picture quality came better. SoundAudio quality was good either on OTTYoutbe or Setup boxDTHUp to 11 days As we not used much and simply using it for watch DTH channels. Everything looks good.After 12 days Amazon replacement time expired then started showing soundAudio problem.TV sound coming very slow, When installed timefirst 10 days, if we set up Volume 15 or 20 it was able give bigger sound, now though we increase volume 60 or 65 not giving the sound that we heard when it installedsetup Played the same content which we listen in Youtube when after installation completed.Regarding this yesterday raised request, online service person asked me to update build version to latest, Now, it is PL.6036 but still have the same problem.2 or 3 days ago while watching suddenly TV got turned off, We did power off and on then it got switch on usually, also after sometime did screen mirroring of youtube and tried decreasing volume from mobile it worked. But, not sure what problem, we believe after that time onwards we have this sound issues.Not sure, seems as I bought from this Amazon or MI service itself does magic to convey customer without actually solving problem.Online service person instead sending Technician to home for verifying problem. Told and did build version update with me to latest Software update. Later, he said Volume limit got increased to 100 now, we have to increase the volume level double or triple to have same sound which have prior. i.e. Before if 1520 volume level gives big sound, then now 5060 volume level the same sound. Asked, when limit increased it should give much more sound otherwise what is the use of Volume limit increase. But, he told OTTsome apps will show difference of this new feature, at the time as I have been on this calls and worries, got tired, I said will see and get back to you with new request.After some time, when I visited my friends better knowledge person on this problem came to know that he cheated me without solving problem, simply said some words to conveytired us.Off course,  I can hear sound at 60 or 70 Volume but my concern is after purchaseinstallation of 13 days only I got this problem, in future how it works and how many further problems shows to me making me cruise.Being middle class person, we give value to single rupee also because we know how much efforts we put on to get that money. After purchase of this MI product crying lot why we went to it instead we could have went for further good brand product though they high in cost.Now, not replaced my TV or not did service by Technician. We decided that we got cheated on and prayed God to take care,Bought two years ago. My panel stopped displaying just one week before the warranty was to expire after two years. They promptly replaced it with a new one. I did not even spend one rupee extra.  Hasslefree. Highly recommend buying Mi products. The product is also awesome.,Good,Best product",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/51xmNdrIlcS._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

I dont really like that clicking sound of mechanical keyboard as I am a software developer and write codes most of the time. Some times that mechanical sound really irritiates, and sometimes seems stressing out my fingers. This keyboard is good. Works as I wanted it to be. But the real issue is, while I am digging my code with mouse, keyboard light goes off and I need to click CAPS or NUM key to lit it again. Its not an issue for average user, but irritates me as I sometime forget to turn on NUM lock and while typing number in my code, I accidentally change edit mode to INSERT due to 0 pressed. Otherwise all seems OK. I wish HP had offered Always ON option for this keyboard.,If there is any wrist support this product will skyrocket in its price range,A good product for this price range ,  RGB light is elegant and good quality keys and its built.....!!,Smooth keystrokes.Uneven distribution of the backlight over the font causing hard to read keys. Only time when all keys are properly readable is when you look at it directly at a perpendicular angle. Since I dont need to look at the letters for normal everyday typing, I can get away with it.There are no indication in the keyboard for the FN  function key combos. Usually in other keyboard there are symbols in the function keys to indicate what they do when pressed with FN.Overall it seems to be acceptable!,Good and value for money,The silver coating came off after 3days.,Does the purpose of backlit and typing. For typing not that great. Buy keyboards that are less mechanical for that.

And the colour looks fabulous.,Size,After 1 year of usage","The product was received without damaged and seal intact. Coming on to the product I bought the jazzy blue sunburn edition.ProsBattery is good, used as opened from the pack it held good for about 10 hours across 4 days and still charge is leftSound Sensible Bass and good mids as well as lows, not that I can discern between them.Aux available.The ear cups are quite big hence sorta provides passive noise isolation.ConsNot foldable as well as type b charger USB micro typeBeing a limited edition if your ear cups wear off very miniscule chances of replacing it with suitable colorIf a person is of hot body typeemits heat or more warm then normal there is higher chances of feeling warmth in your ears, as I heard the material just reflects the heat back on to ears. Thats just plain uncomfortable to me.Also the build feels very flimsy and plasticky.Also a major drawback I felt was that whenever we switch onoff we get the builtin audio!,Bought it for 1499. Now after 2 years 2 months, today it broke. After 6 months of use, the red coating started peeling off. But device showed no problems. Sound is clear, balanced, not very hogh but enough bass, good battery backup, charges faster, aux is available. Disadvantage is you cant fold it. Planning to buy it again, as I think this the best in segment. Now the rate has increased to 1799.,The first thing I want to say is that the headphone is really bulky. I didnt notice the first few days of using but eventually it gives pain on the shoulder if worn for a longer period of time 34 hours, sound quality is good. Do not have any bass, ANC is not present in this headphone. Its a decent headphone for casual purposes. If youre a music lover or wear your headset for longer period of time then I think you should invest in other options, which is light weight and have ANC in them.,Everything is great about boat products. Delivered in two days.Noise cancelling is great. Bluetooth connectivity is good. Something it takes time to connect. If you planning to buy then this would be a great choice.,in details it was written that it has physical noise isolation feature in it  but when it came I didnt observe as such feature I bought it for study purpose that the reason why I was looking for such feature but I found it as a waste of money.,Sometimes .. sound doesnt work .. you have to decrease the volume to zero and then increase again to hear the sound. Bu this happens only 1 out of 10 times.,Build quality is good, has physical noice isolation, soft padded, comfortable, but bass could be quite better, otherwise everything is fine,Best for Gym, study, online lectures, entertainment etc.Please Go for it ,Good quality headphones in Over the ear category. Good quality sound but has less bass as other says but its decent. Good mic quality for meetings but doesnt have any noisecancellation feature. I just feel that after 34 hours of constant use these earphones feel weighted to the neck.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41PlZjYsy-L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 ,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product","I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers arent available and the replacement B43 drivers dont allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.056generic.Google search for morrownr8821au20210708 and use the driver on Github. Im using the product TPLink AC600 btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working read the GitHub Readme.To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for WiFi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the WiFi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the WiFi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktoplaptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop dont support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 3040Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4. I receive 170Mbps  download and 110Mbps upload speed on 5ghz and my broadband plan is 150Mbps.I highly recommend this product.,i purchase this product for company use and this is a very good product.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/21jLkYGoSEL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Since it was white, and therefore a very unappetising sight now, I needed a new one.Packaging The design of packaging was perfect  stiff corrugated sandwich board box, foam profiled panels stuck on board for bottom and top, board wrapping around the glass kettle, the whole unit inside a thick ply cover. Frankly, this sort of packaging is more common in high end audio equipment. 5  plus for the packaging design.Size This is a small machine  and will make about 600 ml of coffee  sufficient for 2 mugs in one go. If you need a larger volume  look elsewhere.Body and finish The plastic body is well made  the matte finish looks good. The bottom metal plate is seamless and black  will have to wait and see when spots appear. The kettle is good quality glass, and though no branding is present, feels thick enough to withstand minor washing bumps. The filter bucket and the holder with the flow control spring is OK  hopefully the spring and washer  which are fixed  will last. The lid moves smoothly and the hinges and the sprinkler also look sturdy. Switch is firm.Function It worked very well on the first use. I had used an extra coffee filter paper on top of the nylon filter bucket. The flow was smooth. Coffee liquor starts weak, and then picks up strength. The drip stops well with the removal of the kettle  and though the manual cautiously states a 10 sec gap for drip stop, I did not find any leakage on longer removal.Overall Very satisfied with my new coffee maker. Recommend buying.,Product doesnt work within a month,Easy to use, and it turned out better than I expected it to be for the price.,Just Magnificent. Saves lot of time.,The plastic quality for this product is poor. It feels like a toy. I had bought a Amazon basics air fryer it had great build quality comparing to this Amazon basics product,If you try to find a replacement part it costs twice its value,its cheap and breakable. And the coffee is very very light,waste of coffee and also not a good flavour.,Nice product and simple to use",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41EuzetRjTL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Well I was wrong.. N Im glad .. I use iem, in ear wired headphones usually.. Used sony skullcandy soundmagic kz.. M not gonna say its better then all of the above but u will be satisfied with the product.. Sound quality is awesome.. Bass is good not like in ear..but still wonderful and enough .. U cant have the effect of an in ear earphones bass quality in a cheap bt.. For that u need to spend at least 10k I think.. It has a passive sound isolation.. Nd its great.. Due to its fit and the foam half of the outer noise gets substacted just by putting it on.. Then the rest go out while the music is on.. Dual mode is good.. But dont think anyone would use the normal mode.. Cant use the phone eq on nt headphones thats a down side.. But u can use other third party eq or the eq in Spotify or saavn works.. The headphones itself might feel it could break cos all of it is made of plastic.. But feels like its a good one... And wont break .. The pads are soft it dosent hurt the head or the ear.. Used it for hours.. Been hearing from a lot of review about the sound quality of these.. But believe me most of them r giving the review after using it for the first time.. Headphone guide 101 u need to burn the drivers I mean u need to use the headphones for a couple of days to get its full potential.. And sound quality is very good.. Vocals are easyly separated bass is enough.. Treble is the right amount the way I like it sound stage is good due to being a on ear with big dynamic driver.. And u would feel the richness of the sound cos of the brand.. A better headphone is the one which creates good and detailed sound.. Not those who are loud.. So yeah I would recommend this over boat. And one last thing.. Due to it being only a bt headphone and no aux cable is available.. The sound quality deepeneds on the device ur using the Bluetooth quality and the amount of sound out put it can produce.. U can charge it with ur nrml charger if its 5v .. Do not use fast charger.. Been using it for two days now.. Need to burn them drivers more.. And will update on the sound quality.. And yeah the battery back up is really good have used it for almost 45 hours still 70 charge left.. It shows in the bt connectivity sec on ur phone.. At the end if ur looking for a headphone with a good premium look a well reputed brand and great sound quality do buy this without a doubt.. This r satisfactory very much.. Go for it.P. S Amazon delivery is really not up to the mark.. Even being a reputed company and all ow and another thing saw some complain about it being manufactured in china mine says manufactured in Malaysia.. Yes its a original one have registered it with harman audio..,Everything, the bass, the battery ..is superb Just a big and only problem, it doesnt support dual Connectivity  which is available in even Boats below 1000 headphonesDual Connectivity is very much required for many, as we have to work together on smartphone  laptop simultaneously.so, again  again disconnecting from lapy the connecting to mobile is just pain.So, Harman please include dual Connectivity.Bought this at 12.5k,Good one, but sound is low.

Switch on the TV, and it already knew me, and my Amazon Prime Account.  After a brief online security check, all my content and apps automatically appeared onscreen, and setup was done!OPTICAL AUDIO OUTIm using a JBL soundbar with subwoofer which are connected to my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV using an optical cable not supplied, and by simply changing settings on the TV my audio system automatically switches on and off with the TV, and the supplied TV Remote has volume controls for my cinema sound.  The sound reproduction is First Class.  I cant comment on the builtin TV Speakers, because I havent used them.PICTURE QUALITYThere are lots of presets for the screen, including Natural, Cinema, Gaming, etc., and you can also set a customised screen to your own liking.  The picture quality is excellent, every bit as good as my other TV from a famous brand that costs 4X the price of my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV.  Im impressed!HDMI  CONNECTIVITYIm only using HDMI1 because all my content is streamed and I have been using an Amazon Firestick, and Google Chromecast.  The Chromecast is plugged into HDMI1, and the TV automatically switches to it when you want to use it.  However, I dont think Ill be using the Chromecast much, because Fire TV is so good, and has an amazing remote control.Im also using a 2TB External hard drive plugged into the fast USB.  Playing movies, even in HD, is a perfect experience with no lag or juddering.Access to the sockets on the wallmounted TV is OK if you have small arms, and although Im only using HDMI1, Optical Audio Out and one USB, there is plenty of connectivity for other equipment.JUST ONE THING...This version of FireTV only allows Alexa to speak 2 languages, viz. English Indian, or Hindi.My Amazon Firestick, Echo Show 8, Echo Show 5, Echo, and Echo Dot all have settings for English UK, Aus, USA, etc, Spanish, French, German, and many other languages.  I really would like to use Alexa on my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV in my native language  it makes it easier for Alexa to understand me, and easier for me to understand Alexa.I hope that this will come in a software update.CONCLUSIONI think that this 55 inch Amazon Fire TV is amazing, and I would recommend it without hesitation.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/51z60rNcKSL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

I have got two of em!","I gifted it to my mother last month it was like love at first sip! easy to use, easy to clean, easy to flex, a blessing for any Indian adult! Still new to french press coffee, so I used South Indian filter coffee for the past few weeks and could instantly feel the difference between a cup of freshly pressed coffee and one of instant coffee, although I have been advised to try grinding my own beans for optimum enjoyment. I seep my grounds for around 34 minutes after heating the press for around a minute or so with hot water and am amazed at how heatresistant the glass is, I would however still advise taking precautions. The markings inside also provide a great measurement of how many cups I would end up making. Not only have i used it for making coffee, but also to froth milk and to make tea. Attaching photos of a coffee i made using this french press with a layer of frothed milk. Ngl, one of the favorite purchases my family made, am thoroughly pleased and highly recommend it to anyone.,Time saving coffeefilter.,Been using this for many months now and its great. Love that it has line measurements. Only thing is I wish the top surface had an arrowtype bump on the plastic to point where the holes are you so you dont have to look down but you can just tell by touch.,Delivery Amazon delivery is always reliable and it didnt fail me this time too..Packaging Both outer packing and the product packaging were intact. Product packing had the right information and was very usefulProduct Very compact. We used several coffee makers in the market, but all required electricity to run. We wanted to have a non electric one which we can easily carry for outdoor and this one fits aptly to our requirements. Just add the coffee powder and hot water. After a while when we press the central pipe, coffee comes out. The nozzle makes it convenient to pour it a cup.For this price in great India sale, I think its worth. I am inclined to give 5 star, but reserving 1 star now. Will use it for a month and come back here to change my rating if it still satisfies me.,Good one for a Black coffee lover,Very very happy with Cafe JEIs French Press. It has become an important part of my daily ritual now in past 10 days. Easy to use and maintain and would recommend buying without hesitation.,Instruction manual could have been a hard copy..too much steps to get the ebook,Got this French Press last year and another one few days back!

Dont bother trying to play videos from USB. Quality is bad.But when connected to right streaming or display source thru hdmi, it is actually quite good. I mean picture quality, colours, brightness etc for a sub 10k projector. In this department this projector can easily compete with many projectors in sub 15k ranges.Sound is also pretty much okay, loud enough more like boat 5w speakers, may be a bit more louder not good quality wise. Quitr workable as portable solution, but not for a permanent setup.Audio output to my studio headphones are pretty decent quality wise and loud also. Meaning 2.1 speakers can be connected to it, for a higher setup, person has to figure out to seperate the audio at the source itself.From 9ft and 34 inches distance of lens to wall, we can get exactly 100 inch87 inch x 49 inch projection. So, it can be called as short throw projector, albiet may be border level. There is an option to reduce the screen size upto 75 of original size electronically once connected to HDMI.Keystone correction is not usuable at all. That wheel has to be exatly in middle position to get a good focus on whole screen.That means one has to setup the projector or screen at a fixed location. Can not lilt the projector to move screen up or down and then adjust with keystone correction. I. e if you want to keep the projector screen at lower levels, projector also has to fixed at lower levels only. Best focus can be get, when projecting exactly oppsite to the projector probably 5 to 6 inch above, so if we flip the projector upside down, we get best focus opposite to center a few inches down.For mysetup, where projecting only 1.5 feet above from the floor, going to use a wall mount to setup the projector upside down, this way i can fix the projector a bit more abovebehind the sofa. I will post the pics later, once it is setup properly.Now the verdict  this projector with a combination of reflective projector screen look it up on amazon xelectron or minago brand is one of most vfm combo for approx 11k for experiencing a very bright 100 inch screen experience of good quality for 1 or 2 person.  But now that im considering buying one of those expensive fixed frame alr projector screens costing upward of 15k to 30k, im thinikg it would have been better if i could have invested a bit more on a brighter projectorlook only ANSI value. This buy was more of an impulse purchase, but it is more then good enough for me now to make me consider much costlier projector screens and then later upgrade to a high end projector.Edit the biggest drawback of this projector is that dust gets inside on lcd panel, which impacts the clarity also after a few days. I had to clean the panel myselg just after 1.5 month.  New lesson learnt, apart from high ansi lumen projector, this is also an important factor for future purchase. Planning to get a custom cloth cover made, so that i dont have to clean it often. Though, Lcd cleaning can be done pretty easily without much opening and its easier compared to youtube videos i have seen for previous model. Somehow lens did not get any dust inside yet. Only the lcd has very very fine dust particles inside.,Quality is good, value for Money. Bluetooth Connectivity is smooth and fast. The sound quality of the Projector is not so great but that we had already considered before. Hotstar App really works nicely with great quality, and so does Youtube. Netflix  Prime video doesnt give the same quality initially, but that must be wifi connection. Some apps however dont get installed, or just close on their own.The good point is the Bluetooth connection, and even we have added a Bluetooth soundbar, so moving it and putting it in any room has become a really good option.,This is indeed a fantastic product in this price range.it is non android so you need to add an amazon fire stick or some other source device through HDMIneedless to say the brightness is pretty good for dark environments and is also watchable during day i.e. if you can cover up your windows and other light sources.Screen spread is Almost up to 120 inch at a throw distance of 13 to 1 feet with the sharpness more or less intact.converts 4K to 1080PWill recommend a tripod mount or a custom made mount like mine.ensure that the walls are white for best image  video reproduction.Definitely recommended at this price point.ConsOnly vertical Keystone correction available,Projector is good so far as it used for last 3 days. May revisit the feedback after a couple of months.,I bought this projector for my classroom and its very helpful for their studies. Now students connect themselves more to the world.,I feel Its a value for money product as I have already used it for last two months.,If u r looking for a home entertainer projector look no further.....

Hope it helps...UPDATE AFTER 4 MONTHS  4HRSDAY USAGE The pic uploaded was by noon 1pm with dark screens...HI, THIS WAS A REPLY TO A CUSTOMER TO HELP CHOOSE BETWEEN EGATE I9 N UC 68  46,  BUT I THOUGHT IF THIS WAS PUT UP IN UPDATE SECTION A LOT WOULD BENEFIT SO HERE IT GOES...First u need to be clear on ur purpose for this projector like if its for offic use or home entertainment, also u didnt mention its source like dth or fire tv stick etc... since u have not ill go with a general review for purposes... ITS GOING TO BE A VERY DETAILED REVIEW SO GUYS WITH OUT PATIENCE CAN RUN TO THE END AT ONCE...!!!I too had a similar confusion based on competition for egate i9 from uc 68  46... Let me tell u what helped me decide...First n foremost egate is an Indian company unlike uc which is a common Chinese product with a namesake brand UC confirmed it with my friend in China... Hence service n general trust is more on egate than competition...Secondly, from fellow customers, Ive learnt that egate is brighter than the rest two...Thirdly, the images are sharp and theres no blur on text on egate compared to the other two... Just learn to adjust the keystone properly...Fourth, the length of the power cord is longer in egate...Fifth, its got a lens cover to close the lens when not in use... The others dont have it...Now in general Ive not used the other two but the input of data for the other two are from their users, so Im gonna tell u wat Ive done n wat else u can do with egate...Ive placed it at a length of 15 feet from the screen n it gives awesome display... Connect a 2.1 5.1 home speaker system if u r trying for home theatre effect but the inbuilt speaker is good enuf at 23 feet projection from the end of ur bed with kids sleeping around...Ive connected my SECOND FIRE TV Stick, with it so it connects to WiFi for movies n serials n mirroring is done by it for playing from mobiles n game too like cod n pubg n FF... Also u have connectivity for laptop n pendrive etc...U get a remote which functions well along with it...MOST IMPORTANTLY, U CAN CEILING MOUNT IT OR TRIPOD IT TOO WHICH THE OTHER TWO CANT... BUT remember if u r ceiling mounting it u need to flip the display by 180 in the settings coz u would mountbit upside down as the option is provided under the projector but for tripod its not necessary...Also u can place the projector behind the screen LIKE AN ACTUAL THEATRE IF U R USING A CLOTH SCREEN LIKE ME N CONSTRAINT OF SPACE, BUT REMEMBER TO FLIP THE IMAGE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT IN SETTINGS AS THE PROJECTOR IS BEHIND THE SCREEN N U NEED TO GET A 90 FLIPPED IMAGE FROM BEHIND...so I guess its the 3d part that made ur decision murky, wat I would love to say for that is Ive a Samsung 3d enabled smart tv n Ive seen the output of these kind of cheap 3d devices too, since its a low cost projector 3d effects are going to give u a headache coz of pixelation better to opt for a TV if 3d is a priority, as in TV the 3d effects r awesome... But nowadays u can install an APP IN ANY DEVICE to watch 3d movies or better download a 3d movie in pendrive n play it n watch it with ur 3d glasses... My friends do it but I DONT...VERDICT  BEST PROJECTOR IN MARKET IN MY OPINION FOR THE PRICE AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSENOTE  FOR AMAZON PRIME N NETFLIX USERS, IF U R USING A 2.1 AUDIO OUTPUT SOMETIMES U MIGHT NOT GET AUDIO SO DONT GET WORRIED N ITS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PROJECTOR ITS JUST THAT THE LATEST MOVIES ARE MADE WITH DOLBY 5.1 SOUND SO JUST USE THE ON SCREEN SETTING IN THE VIDEO TO NAVIGATE TO SOUND N CHOOSE STEREO FROM THE DEFAULT DOLBY OPTION  VOILA U R DONE...!!!HOPE IT HELPS, PING ME FOR ANY DOUBTS...HIT LIKE, IF MY REVIEW WAS USEFUL...!!!,As per money its bestBut if you are fan of pictures qualityThink about budget",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/51DhRNtyo0L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Havells Immersion HB15 1500 Watt ,Nickel plating for corrosion resistanceThermal Cut Off : No|Efficient heat transfer heating element. Power: 1500 watts; Operating Voltage: 220 - 230 volts. Rated Voltage :50 Hz AC|Touch protection cover|Elegant & Sturdy bucket hook|ISI marked 3 pin modeled plug|Waterproof|Heating Indicator,"Needs accessories,Gets water hot in under 10 mins,Slightly disappointed,Useful,Value for your money,Havells water heater is an excellent product.,v.nice,This product is very good and easy to use","Immersion heaters have changed very little in terms of features or design over the 40 years or so Ive been using them. And regardless of which brand name is stamped on them, they look like clones of each other. It was therefore with some excitement that I bought this Havells model that had at least three novel features an autocutoff facility, a temperature control knob, and a protective plastic cover for that part of the heater users could come into accidental contact with. But quite a bit of my excitement drained away when the heater arrived. I couldnt use it straightaway because it has a cord thats barely a metre long, and it just couldnt reach the 16A socket it needs to be plugged into. Such heavyduty sockets are normally positioned high in most bathrooms, so that they are easily accessible to any storage waterheaters that may be installed. Havells should have made allowances for this and added at least another footandahalf to the cord length. For a largescale manufacturer, this extra length would have made little difference to the production cost. The product, anyway, is priced a couple of hundred Rupees more than other 1500W heaters the MRP being even higher, at Rs1000.In my case, therefore, the heater had to be accessorized before it could be used I had to buy a stool that would raise the the bucket off the floor, and thus compensate for the shortness of the cord. And no, it cant be any stool lying around in your home it has to be a stool of a certain height, about 14 inches for me. Any taller, and the bucket cant be accommodated under the tap any shorter, and you begin cursing Havells again for their miserliness with the cord. The stool took two days to arrive, and I inaugurated the heater a full four days after it was delivered. Thank God my old immersion heater was still usable, in spite of its heavily calcified condition.There is yet another problem with this heater though it helpfully allows you to choose between three temperature settings, you dont know what value each setting corresponds to. What does high temperature mean  60 degrees Celsius Seventy I found out the hard way when I set the temperature high, and the heater wouldnt switch itself off for 15 minutes, which is five minutes longer than the time my old heater takes to heat up some 20 litres of water. And by then, the water had turned scaldingly hot. I tried the medium setting the next day, and again had the nasty experience of having to deal with extra hot water. Perhaps the right setting is low then. Im not sure. Neither the product literature that came with the heater nor the Havells website has any information that will help you choose the right setting, and stop you burning yourself.So both the innovative features of this heater that made me buy it  the variable heat setting and the autocutoff ultimately turned out to be quite useless. I still have to depend on my instinct, and on my experience with my old featureless heater, and manually turn the heater off when I think its done its job.I have a question for other users of this product, or for the manufacturer can the temperature be set to inbetween values, something between low and medium, for instance. The way the controlling knob is marked, with several lines between the presets, suggests this is possible. Or maybe thats yet another useless feature of this fancy heater. More trialanderror But should such a basic piece of equipment be so difficult to useUpdateAfter a weeks use of this heater, Id like to add a word of caution for the benefit of other buyers and users. Since the heater has its own indicator light, which switches off at the set temperature, you may forget to switch the socket switch off, particularly if the switch is away from the socket, as in some contemporary bathrooms that have all switches bunched together at the bathroom door. If you forget to switch the socket off, and, in the meantime, have removed the heater from the bucket, it will begin to heat up again once the temperature has fallen below the set value. This dryheating will damage both the heater and wall, if youve hung the heater up. But, more significantly, it will also be extremely hazardous if your body is wet, and theres no one around to switch the socket off for you. This happened to me twice. Call me dumb, if you want to, but please be careful.,The product is good and does its work. I didnt find any use of the thermostat feature as though it turns off automatically the low temper in itself is very hot. It take just 5 to 7 mins to get the water be bath ready. Further the product says that ilthe rod should not touch the bucket but the product handle is made in such a way that it touches, but that causes no trouble. Its not shock proof so dont check temperature of water with it turned on.,Product received with some scratchesDont know how inside package product gets scratchesOther than that all is okay product is goodAnd its shock proof for extra safety but no recommended to touch water,Value for money,Product is good  satisfactory, one minor issue the cord is little too hard.,Its working as expected. no issues found till now  but i have observed the red light is not coming fully. i could see only partial red light is visible. overall best product,nice,This product is very good and easy to use but its plug is of 16 amps which should have been of 6 amps",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31flPimoFpL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros1. Sound is awesome  100 satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim  It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4. Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. It gets integrated with mobile apps, remote, WiFi networks very quickly and easily.6. The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. It supports all the smart features like Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and signin to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons1. Picture quality is 776p. Its average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. Ill not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and dont have extensive smart use then 100 go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but its very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and Im ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon. Im very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when its been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when Im having my smart TV delivered to my home, I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,Good product,Connectivity is faster,But performance is little bit slower,,The biggest problem I face is it dont have a aux cable so Im not able to connect my sound bar......the HDMI port is useless it wont work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it wont connect automatically, everytime I on the tv i need to connect it manually its a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now its been 4 months and its super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......thats all,Good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice. Budget friendly, Im happy with this .,After a few days, the TV will perform slowly and the  remote  is very very sentence,thank you amazon and oneplus,1. Sound is good2. Easy installation3. very Slim and less weight4.

I only had one option to contact the customer care so, I contacted them and explained the issue in detail. They asked me to hold and connected me to an so called expert. The expert did not ask me anything just asked me to upload a picture that I already did. Then so called expert asked me to upload the picture on the link that she would be sharing, which I never received. I even tried rating but thanks to the amazon iOS app even that was not possible coz there was no scroll bar on the rating tab.

Just excellent. Accuracy top notch. Feeling while in hande is awesome. Feels very big in hand. Very comfortable to hold for long time. Design is very good.,nice mouse love it... decent mouse with ecent price..,If you are buying this mouse exclusively for gaming, dont cause the polling rate is no different than lets say a cheap dell mouse you see at work exact polling rate of this mouse is 125hz which is very low if you want precise aiming in competitive. But the redeeming feature might be the looks. The rgb looks cool but you cant use just one single color. It feels great in hand but my thumb has to pull back a lot to press the lower side button but that can be attributed to my long thumb. The cables braided too so theres that!Verdict Great value is you can get it for around Rs. 400 considering its looks and other subtle features.,,A fine mouse for what its worth.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31luFfya0kL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Good for living rooms about 12x12 ft or even bigger space. I installed it and connected to TV using coaxial cable. Volume, clarity, bass, everything is perfect. Overall value for money product.Long review  I have experience other company speakers like JBL and Sony and had decided to buy those, but this one is similar in sound quality. Treble is nice and crisp. Vocals sound nice even at higher volumes. Bass is amazing  fills entire room with that BOOM sound. Watching movies and listening to music is much better now with these speakers.Used these for about 7 days and overall experience is good. Sound bar not subwoofer  Size is big considering this is 80W, but for me this is perfect size as it matches my TV length and looks good. Subwoofer  Small and compact unit. Bass is amazing. Gives that boom effect in action scenes and when listening to music. Remote  Minimal but functional remote. Has all the required features in single click. Connectivity  Does not have optical SPDIF but thats ok as Coaxial option is available and mostly all TVs have Coax connectivity only. Take a look below for Bluetooth connectivity. Overall Bluetooth works very well, except when you connect certain devices with newer hardware.I have a smaller unit installed in another room and always used to watch movies on that speaker unit. But after listening to this one, I feel sound, and bass of that other unit is just very low. This one really sounds good and makes watching movies and listening to music a good experience.Note I think the unit uses Bluetooth 4. If you have devices with new BT 5.0 drivers or hardware, when you connect such newer devices, treble and sound quality has minor issue. Not much but still you can hear it in some situations that treble, and vocals are not clear. This is not an issue when you use your mobile to connect using Bluetooth. I wanted crystal clear sound, so I have connected using coaxial cable and sound quality is amazing over wired connection.,Sound quality is average not up to the mark, the best but AUX mode not working,It would be good it the sound system was more better ,Best,Nice prodect,Remote playback so best mujhe to acha laga tag zebronic",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31flGUWUY9L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

The picture quality is good and the streaming capabilities are convenient. The user interface is easy to navigate, although it did take me a little bit of time to get used to it.However, I do have a few issues with the TV. The sound quality is not the best and I have noticed some lag when switching between apps. These issues do not significantly impact my viewing experience, but they are worth mentioning.Despite these issues, I would still give the Kodak TV 3 stars out of 5. It is a decent TV for the price, but there are certainly better options out there. I was offered an additional 3 months of warranty if I wrote a review, but I am not particularly interested in extending the warranty at this time.It is not appropriate or ethical to write a false or misleading review in exchange for incentives, such as an extended warranty or other perks. Doing so goes against Amazons guidelines and can lead to consequences for both the customer and the company.It is important to be honest and transparent in your reviews and to only write about your genuine experiences with a product. This helps other customers make informed decisions about their purchases and ensures that the review system remains fair and trustworthy.If you are not satisfied with the Kodak TV or do not feel comfortable giving it a high rating, it is perfectly okay to give it a lower rating or to not write a review at all. It is always better to be honest and genuine in your reviews, rather than attempting to manipulate the system for personal gain.,Issues with chrome casting,I did not believe such a good feature would be available at this price.  I liked the feature of supporting the Ethernet port and earphone jack.,Kodak tv,For the amount being charged, this is a acceptable TV.The Kodak 7XPRO  model is same as Thomson 9A series.Despite being 32 big, this was lighter than my previous Bravia 18 TV and easily mounted to the previous wallmount. Note The wall mount holes are plasticky and dont have any metal insert.The remote sensor is separate module projecting from the underside of the TV and does not look integrated  with the main body.The two USB ports are side by side which dont interfere with each other.The Audio out port is a good feature if one wants to watch TV without disturbing others.When i first connected the TV to my settop box over HDMI, there was only picture and no sound.The person at the service center whose number is listed on the TVs warranty card said that they dont support this and i need to call the TV manufacturer. so much for printing a service center number on warranty card.This was fixed after changing the HDMI CEC settings in the settop box not TVs fault.There is no usermanual given with the TV. most people, based on their experience with phone should be able to ultimately figure out the connections. The only included leafletbook whose pages were all stuck together talks about the Android menu, There is no info on the TVs input jacks like what the HDMI ARC stands for.I got multiple calls after the purchase to enquire about delivery and if i needed installation.As i already had a previous wall mount on which this could get attached with no hassles, I opted out of installation service.,All is welllll,Good tv,Picture quality is very good",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ZptRPWCPL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Now right earbud gets discharged in hour and a half, whereas left one keeps going, so reducing one star. Will contact them for replacement and update here.Update 2 Called service center, they asked to bring it, but am lazy. I expected theyd replace at home. Paid more attention towards the issue above. The stable situation is that just after full charge, right bud can go upto 4 hrs, but left one always goes for 3060mins more, and the difference is more if there is a standby of a day or two when the left one loses juice rapidly it seems, so I guess I can still use the buds but with certain restrictions  Will happily restore 5 stars if the issue stays stable for next 3 months.Update after 6 monthsNo change in quality, still the pack charges the buds like a boss. During this period, they were once kept in mouth by my infant nephew for over half an hour very dangerous, thankfully he couldnt swallow them!, full of saliva and whatnot, and on another occasion I threw one of my earbuds on the floor with full force undisclosed depressing reason due to which the touch panel with the logo got detached, which I then reattached. After all this, buds are still rocking with same sound quality as on day 1. I think these are pretty darn sweet deals! Lack of volume control, etc. etc. is all forgiven. Happy customer. Although the issue of left earbud discharging earlier than right persists.Original reviewUsing for last 2 months.I am an audiophile and also an instrumentalist. But I hadnt used any tws yet, so wanted to dip my toes and didnt want to invest much, but also not something throwaway. So settled for boult no boat etc. due to their highly adultered sound signature, since I have previous experience with it. I like my music flat at studio quality. More recently, Ive been using a low cost headphones with mindblowing performance oneodio pro50. Go ahead and search it. It is really one of a gem for all those purist sound fans.Coming to this tws.Connectivity. Right out of the box, only left one was working after connecting to my iphone. Maybe right one didnt pair correctly to left. Did that reset thing as suggested which also took some effort, but after that, both started working and since then, no issues. I am using both my phone and laptop linux. Ofcourse you need to disconnect one to use another. But perfect connectivity now. I can move around in my 1300 sqft apt and no connection loss, which is great.Call quality is decent, faced no disconnects yet, and the other party is also ok with my voice, but you cannot talk in a hushed voice, you always need to speak up in a medium volume to let the other party understand you.Features. Tapping is oddly sensitive, I mean it responds even if I am adjusting the bud, and not touching the central area, but surprisingly takes a decent tap punch to playpause. I can get used to that though. One thing, track aage peeche is ok. But these dont have anything which can control the volume. Bummed on that.Battery. Decent backup. Its been nearly 2 months. I use buds on an average of 23 hours daily, and I just had to charge the main case just 34 times. In an emergency I also used it to charge my iphone which it did really quickly. I was happy to see that. One weird thing to notice is that the right earbud always discharges more quickly than the left, infact I can use the left one 2030 mins more that the right. But anyways, I put them both in the case once any one of them starts to complain of low battery.Sound quality.Bass frequencies Very decent bass. Surprisingly great low bass songs like the humma song, i wanna love you sound pretty good, but a bit lacking in other frequencies of bass lut gaye by Jubin doesnt sound that punchy as it should for a flat signature. Overall for the most part, you should be fine.Other frequencies Ill review this from vantage point of studio quality signature. For mids, the spectrum is tilted towards bit of high bass but surprising absence of very specific high bass frequencies as mentioned above, but its bearable. For highs, initially I felt the presence a bit lacking, which takes away that warmth and fidelity from a few tracks, but after using it for a few days, I started feeling alright in that aspect, maybe some burn in God knows. Also remembering that I paid just 1800 bucks for these! I mostly will be using these while my walking and workout sessions, so I think my mind wont be nitpicking then. Ill soon be upgrading though.Overall, really a very decent purchase with good sound quality provided you can get these for under 2k. Cheers!,Hey.  .This one item has a built quality is like a stone..and also the working condition and sound quality it is marvelous, but only one problem is the noise cancellation that not working properly which means when we are in a crowded area while recording something or a call to another person the unwanted noises are coming they cannot hear properly our voice thats the only disadvantage on this one..,Right buds not performs well, I am trying to change music to next but it still plays the same which should not happen according to manual,Been using these for a month now. Cant massively complain, the sound quality is decent enough may not be good enough for big music heads, not enough bass and provides good noise isolation. Very impressed by the battery life with the charging case, and I use it every day. If you can snag it on a deal for 1500 bucks its a fantastic deal.,My only issue is,  we cant change the connection to 2 devices by 1 click.  Every thing else is fine.,Best at price. and require some button for operation.,call pick up rejection function, next song play function not working on single touch,Product is good but battery not as expected",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41vEB+mY55L._SY300_SX300_.jpg

Wires are great built and tangle free. The audio jack is compatible with almost all devices and its gold plated as well. I just didnt find the case. It was missing from my product. Though they have given 2 pairs of extra buds with different sizes. Overall its a great wired in mic earphones. Go ahead and add to your cart. You wont regret it.,So first, lets talk about the externalBulid quality is awesome 910 even at such an affordable price.LooksI have all 3 colours of these earphones and all colours looks coolWirethe wire quality is 910. I have these earphones from 4 months and these havent tangled since. Also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives a nice  looking effect.But 1 thing I have seen is the middle piece which have a mic and buttons is 180 degree reversed. so, many times its difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing. But it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easy.Now about the main part the internalsThe sound quality is so so nice. As you can see in my title. Solid 810. You can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when its time for a party you can listen rock, bass boosted songs with such a adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap prices.Bass quality is also good.perfect for the ears. And if u want high bass, I tried it with max bass it can produce and thats awesome. But dont listen high bass for long. Those can hurt ur ears really bad.But noice cancellation is 410.seems like there is no noice cancellation. Maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpiece.Obviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost 2000. But I will choose this product instead of a 1500 one or less than 1500 because this cost less than 500 or sometimes less than 400depends on sale but quality and services of these products are not less than of a 2000 rs earphone.In past, 1 of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous, there services are so cool and quick. So those got replaced within 3 days. its 3 days because I forgot the eslip, if you mail them with everting ready it wont take more than 2 working daysIts an honest review by me and I will definitely suggest you to but these. EditedTheir services are slower now. Dont know why and it takes around 1. 5week to 2 weeks to get the refund. If something happens to ur earphones.Also its been like 1 year as of 1921And I saw some trend with it. My brother earphones stop producing sound from one side evey 4 months or soBut mine earphones be with me for 5 months.Its not a problem though cause you can mail em regarding this. This happened with me even with extra proper care of the earphone.Still the best earphones, you can find at this price point,NOT FOR HIGH BASS LOVERS,Everything was OK but as shown in the picture that you will get a case along with earphones,which was not there inside itonly earphone and some earplucks were there,This range very good product.if your budget under 400 definitely you can bye this product.,Nice product,Product is good but the accessories like the pouch is not provided as mentioned in the description in the second delivery also, despite the return of first delivery of the product  for REPLACEMENT with pouch,product is good but needs to work on noise cancellation",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41EnFjIAoaL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

Bass quality 45 noise cancellation 45,Old and damage product,Good as price,Very gud at this price range   superb,Nice",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KBaLUTYHL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

It was rattling in the box before being opened.After a couple of days of very light use, probably no more than 1020 pages, both printer cartridges ran low, and the black already ran out. I had to replace it.When I was installing the printer, I had noticed that the cartridges did not have the protective tape over them. Didnt think much of it then.It feels like this was a printer that was being used somewhere and they put it into a new box when shipping. Or someone opened a new box, inserted used cartridges, and took out the new ones.The scanner also does not seem to work.The printing is fine and works. I think the problem is with the company that sold and shipped it to me  somethings amiss here.,Its nice but take time to installation which cause trouble at once after that its easy to use,Best one for home need!,Got delivered today and I set up using the cable and fired few prints..

NC is not that good but cancels subtle noises and turn down down other noises. People talking are not canceled, only muted down. Sound is good for the price range45. If you are looking for superior NC, try to buy sony xm4s wheb there is an offer which is my next headset to buy. The cushions are far too small to fully cover ear, they kinda rests on ur ear edges which is kinda painful over long usage. There was no sweating issue since the headphone has air holes and provide air circulation to ears. Charging time was around 1 hour. Battery life is so perfect, like u can charge this full and use it for a while week without NC with around 5to6 hrs of daily usage. So final verdict is bang for the bucks. If u r into NC, just go buy xm4s... ,Good quality product,Very good for phone calls.The microphone is excellent. Much better than most Bluetooth earphones.The audio is clear, but the shape of the earbuds fails to direct the audio reliably across different types of ear sizes.JBL tried replicating the Apple earbud shape.

Quality is good, looks nice. Comfort wise, the clamping force is a bit tight, if you like the cozy feel, good for gym or running. Sound isolation is good. Earcups are slightly small for over ear, would keep touching the edges of your ears, you may get used to it or not. Besides bass, the sound is good. Battery life and connectivity is good too.

I quite impressed with packaging n box content they are USPNext comes plastic quality that is also good installation was also easy by following manual.. link for video would be more helpfulIt do have sometime connecting issue thats random..Which could be the reason this is reasonably priced..Next version should improve that rest happy with purchase,It provides excellent backup for above 4 hrs but during power cut the router restarts once again which created interruption in the internet connections for few minutes... Overall an Awesome Product,I have tested and its working for power backup up to 2 hrs...,Perfect for wifi usage upto 3 hrs of power backup provided.

Item runs 1hr 14m 1A giving 15.465Wh, runs 48m 1.5A giving 14.82Wh whereas its rated at 22.2Wh  since its april21 made, id say battery is defective  wont last me long, ordered replacement.2. Replacement runs 1h 32m 1A giving 19.39Wh, 1h 1m 1.5A giving 18.452Wh  being made in nov20 i think this batt is alright. Im keeping the replacement  ending my review unless item fails catastrophically.Update...1. This is what make in India has become a plethora of Indian registered companies slapping their logo  selling chinese items in India, to cash in Indian sentiments. This is a generic item sold by slapping diff brand names like zinq, quantum available right here on amazon  prolly more. Even the boxes r exactly same... lol.2. Recharge rate is horribly slow 0.5A, so 2.2Ah will take 4.4hrs, considering losses 4.5hrs. Thats why frequent power cut ppl r complaining about 1hr standby. So its basically for ppl with occasional power cuts like me with community generator.3. Ups has to be turned ON to recharge... what why lame! This is another reason ppl r complaining about charging issue  since item is generic, ZINQ prolly doesnt even know... lol... such a dumb thing must be printed on the center of the box itself. I myself was fooled for 6hrs thinking that its charging but it went cold so checked with power meter  wow! It didnt charge a bit.4. Had i been younger with lotza free time, i couldve made one myself for 80808015050 for 1.8Ah one... Gone r those fun days! So Im keeping it for 1001. if any1 is reading my review, youtube search for router ups  lotza young ppl with free time have made such DIY.Damn this thing can output over 35watts of power 12v. For the 1st time something has outspecked my 35w load tester.Pros1. Can output 3A or even more, that i could test. Great for sudden load surge.2. Very stable output 1212.1v throughout 035w.3. Solid built, almost all possible connectors provided, seamless switching from AC to battery obviously, easy to use.Cons1. No polarity changing option for inout. Some itemschargers do have center negative, for that i have to make my own cable.2. Since it went 3A or above, i dont think theres any overloadshort circuit protection.3. Item got quite hot when run at 12v 2A for 15mins. I hope theres thermal protection.4. Item is sealed shut. Any repair or future battery change will be destructive.,It works as intended and gives 45 hours battery backup for wifi.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4148+QSBxXL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

Change the earbud tips to ones that fit more snugly in your ears|Crystal clear voice & call quality with 3 mics & a Voice Pick Up unit|Deep & spacious sound tuned by AKG. Sensors: Accelerometer, Gyro, Proximity, Hall, Touch, Grip, VPU|Eye-catching design in a glossy finish that keeps you connected yet comfortable through the day","Little above average Earbuds,Buds i love,Unique form factor,Best call quality ear buds,Good but is it worth it,Bluetooth range not that good,Excellent sounding pair of earbuds with one fatal flaw,Bluetooth connectivity is not upto the mark","The earphones have good clear sound quality. It lacks base. Battery backup is good. ANC is a myth in this earphone. It might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your ear,Eat easily fit in ears and light weight ,and sound quality is good too. Over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile too.,Bought this solely due to its form factor  to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style. To be true Samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique TWS.This is not an inear style TWS but resembles somewhat earbud style TWS, only of its kind in the market as far as my Knowledge goes.They are held very good in my ears, gives me a good seal and does not fall out strange as I cant use earbuds because they fall out frequently. It seems that Samsung has finalised the shape after a good homework. However, it doesnt mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globe.The finish, build and all such generic factors are top notch.  The size of the buds and the case is very small.Now about the sound. If the buds fit in ones ears with a good seal, the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect, it may be tinny.The sound signature is very bassy for my taste and I have to eq it to my taste. The bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get a taste of the treble. I listen it in TREBLE BOOST mode adjusted through the app. ANC works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable. In contrary, ANC ON somewhat opens up the sound. Dont buy this for ANC.Strangely to me, these buds sound better on my iPhone 12mini than my Galaxy S22 Spotify and Apple Music. The buds have app support for both Android Galaxy wear and iOS Galaxy Buds Live but the Android app is more feature packed and works better.  The iOS app couldnt update the firmware although there is a Menu in the app and always showed the device to be on latest firmware. However,  as soon as I connected with my S22, on pairing,  the first thing it did was to update the firmware.I love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for 4.4K against an MRP of 16K. The do sound very good but does not suit my taste.  Persons loving bass may love them. Dont get them for ANC. Battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok. It has wireless charging too. If your ears are too small or too large than normal  better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper seal.,Best call quality. Noise cancelling could have been improved to best, but still wotks good.Descent battery life.Music is good. Not to that top notch, but good in this segment.Overall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but good.,I am using this for like 3 months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its price.,Bluetooth range is not that good,The sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat. I got these for Rs.5290, it almost felt like a steal deal for me until I faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds. The bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance. It feels like I am using bluetooth v3.0. The range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket, the audio starts stuttering. The mic quality is a hit or miss, inside the house it works very well, but outside it performs poorly. I think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphones quality. If you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception, then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing. Samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault. I pity those who bought it at around 15k for such a flawed product. Even at Rs 5k it is not worth it because of the range issue. It is better to buy a wired IEM, atleast it will sound better than this.,In this price Samsung brand is goodEasy to wear and good battery backupHardly support the 2 meter Bluetooth connectivity",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Sx7+mu+vL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

Dont waste your money on this product,Everything is best but build quality is avg,lets get directly into the Pros  Cons sry it will be a long review coz the review have to be useful for everyone who plans to buy this.Pros The Price, given to this price bracket its the best one i can suggest from the built quality to the Audio quality its superior for the price 499 i got for this price tagthen the Comfort, everybody complaining about the earpads i dont know why, if your going for over the ear type u have to be known that u cant wear it all day long the most expensive products also tend to warm your ears and get a little uncomfortable, so if its not preffered u can go for earphones or earbuds. as i bought multiple ober the ear headphones there will be rought cloth like texture that will irritate your ears, But this One has SOFT CUSHION like material, im really comfortable with this one.and next the Audio Quality, i have previosuly owned boult inear earphones so i know the bass quality and vocal quality, so i booked this without even thinking twice, and it has delivered what it can. the best part is im really comfortable in this one than my inear earphones, the sound is even better and you dont get high volume levels like those local cheap products on the markets. but the Bass and Clarity will give you some extra feel, especially the BASS.. its really engaging, if ur a Bass lover go for it.then the Quality, i know the Boult for sometime but for over the ear headphones at this price point i was little skeptical about the build quality before the delivery and it suprised me, dont think that build quality is extraordinary like sennheiser or Sony coz ur not paying that much for this, so for this price its so good, even better than the boat headphones which is slightly high in the price tag.Now Cons little skeptical about the Warranty, because when i gone to register this and both while i was registered my boult inear earphones, they didnt asked for Invoice slips and No serial number is asked, then how can they proceed if we call for the warranty claims... but hopefully i think this will last long as seeing the quality. Next is the Cable Quality, i didnt complaining about it, but they mentioned in amazon as its an Kevlar Cable, so i expected a lott but its a normal cable bt its Sturdy enough. i didnt check the mic on it, i make a call on this, the other person was able to understand me, but i dont know hows the quality.To Help you guys, i have metioned every aspect in detailed manner so it can helpful for people who spend their valuable money coz every single rupee counts..Have a Nice and Safe Shopping. Bye,achhi product he,Got the product delivered unharmed in 6 days.I got it for 499.This is the best branded product in this price range.Sound quality is pretty good considering the price.Bass is good but the loudness is a bit low, you have to listen them above the 50 level of your mobile.Clearity is very good.I bought them for online lectures and they worked great for the purpose.Ear cups are comfortable and reduces much background noise, besides they arent known for passive noise cancellation.The wire attached to the ear cups is a bit delicate and may break if pulled forcefully so you have to handle it carefully.I have attached a pic with side by side comparison of my old Boat Rockerz 400 which I bought for 999 in 2018 and they lasted for a very long duration of 4 years.The Boult Audio Q2 looks a bit delicate as compared to Boat Rockerz, but dont forget theres a double price difference between them.Lets see how long it goes....Summing up this is the best product in this price segment 500. Just go for it if you get the same.,Noise level is so high I couldnt listen more than 5 minutes.. So I like to choose another brand please refund for this product,Quality not as expected level,I use this product for mostly in gaming and listening songs but there are no mic in it",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31IO--RzGbL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Simultaneously I was using the USB ports in the Hub for connectivity of my wireless mouse and one port for external harddisk.  This continuously gave me problems with connectivity of the mouse or the HDD.  I got errors like USB device not detected etc.  Till a point, where it refused to detect my mouse.At home, I used the hub for connecting only to my external HDDs two numbers and it is working fine.  For a moment, I was trying to return the product, but since I got this delivered in Mumbai at my Office and then I had returned home to Karnataka, it refused to process return in a different city.Right now, it is working fine, since I do not need ethernet at home.,Speed is more than wireless,I am not used since it restricted in my system.,I have used it with HP and Dell Laptop. Its compatible with all. Its plug and play and easy to use.,Good product,It works perfectly,A trusted and a reliable brand with a convenient design having a slot for folding the cable. It works and works well every time.However, they made 2 strange design decisions that take some points off the satisfaction of using of the product1 There is a bright white light on the product which keeps flashing when the connection is active. It is a huge annoyance when Im working at night.2 The cable is flat, which is like a doubleedged sword. On one hand, it comes in handy when folding it on itself and redacting into the body. But when its not hidden and used with a laptop, with the adapter being visible, the flat cable folded sideways looks ugly.The product wouldve been a perfect 55 if TP Link didnt make these strange design decisions. Hope this helps. Thanks.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21uJX5AqizL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

It is boxy in shape but a no nonsense and powerful air purifier. Easy to assemble, easy to clean and good air flow. The silent mode will be more than sufficient if it is PM that youre trying to get rid of. The purifier is so effective that it draws out moisture also so do not be surprised if you feel a dry throat in the morning. I run it for a few hours in silent mode and then switch it off to avoid the dehumidifier effect. Worth the price and great customer service.,I am extremely happy with this purchase.The purifier is very sensitive to impure air, and makes sure to trigger purification of highest level to bring the AQI down under Good quality.The HEPA filter has longer life than most other products. Also, the AQI indicator is through at LED indicator that is more accurate than the digital interface which comes with other products.The installation and functioning is extremely simple and can be done in 5 minutes.The best part is the support you receive from Coway. The day the delivery from Amazon was supposed to happen, I got a call from support executive intending to help with installation and related things. A follow up call was also made to describe more.The product comes with 5 yr warranty and additional two years was provided upon registration.My flatmate also purchased the same after seeing mine functioning.,Good,Only drawback I found is that it does not show any reading for the pollution level. After turning it on in auto mode it turns from red to orange and then to green within 1015 mins, but showing the pollution level along would have been more convincing.,I wanted a no nonsense machine for the childrens bedroom, to control and allergies and dust especially during the winter  smog season here in Lucknow. My kids are happy with the machine since it is very easy to use and I am happy since it seems quite easy to maintain as compared to the other brands  models. Rajnish gave a nice quick demo of how to use it and maintain the device, and also how to register for the 7 yr warranty. For now, I am quite satisfied with the service and the product.,I got this product as second purifier in home. Amazed to see the performance with simplistic looks and no jaziness. Works well. I think two things can be enhanced  1. Provide a handle to move the product around and 2. Color option.Rest all no complaints.For testing I opened the windows and then ran this purifier and in the same room I kept my Dyson to monitor AQI level. Within 30 mins it brought down the AQI level in room which was monitored by Dyson.Happy with the quality and highly recommended.,",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51b5sh94f7L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Tap water has alot of impurities and gets stuck and reduces the life of iron. I have seen that myself with my other steam iron as it leaves small dust particles on the waterstorage area.

After getting it checked I found out that the issue was in the UPS maybe wiring cable which stopped transmission.I contacted the customer care and I was assisted by Mr. Ankit. He was very helpful and asked me to demonstrate the issue in video and tried to ascertain the issue through other checkups too. After ascertaining that the issue is in the product he confirmed to get the default product replaced and started the issue and informed me on tentative timelines for the same. Hoping to receive the replacement soon so that I can continue uninterrupted internet !!,I have been using this product for the past four months, during this tenure I had faced no issues initially but roughly after 3 months the power back up started shrinking extremely and the least duration was under 30 minutes, thats when I contacted the customer support via whatsapp and I must say the whole experience with the customer support team was simply surprising. They were very polite and helpful throughout the process. It was very easy for me to explain the issue to them then at the end of the first conversation itself they arranged a replacement for the product since it is just 34 months old. They took all the responsibility of the issue and sent me a new product which I am currently using, now the back up I am getting is 4 hours which is based on my usage.So finally I am not sure how often I buy a product from this brand but I will never forget the support I received from this this brand. Cheers!!!,I purchased the product 10 days back and initial product was not working properly. But I received a replacement for that. Thanks for immediate response from the support team. I liked Oakter because its Indian product and NOT a Chinese. As of now its working fine and no lag in WiFi connection or speed. Need to test the recharge capacity when the Power goes off. Will keep you updated after a month again by checking the results. Giving 4 Stars as of now.,This is a really good option for those who are primarily concerned about being cut off from online meetingscalls due to frequent short term power cuts, and are not willing to spend more amount buying an inverter. I have been using this product since around 3 months and am pretty happy with its backup.,I have been using the product for more than a year. Later I purchased a second product for my parents home and it was working fine for 6 months. However the backup battery stopped working later and the customer support team were quick to respond and swiftly sent me the replacement product.,Product was delivered very promptly and packaging was good. Using this product just from couple of days and its working as expected. Very easy to plug  use. Reserving 1 star for longevity of this product, will revise my rating after a year or so depending on my experience.,The device doesnt support for 4 hours. It support only for 2 or 2 hours 30 minutes max on full recharge.Product is affordable, light and good. Please dont fool on 4 hours support capacity. Resonate UPS is better as compared  to this.,This product claims to give backup for upto 4hours. But it wont even give backup for 30 mins. I claimed warranty and got the new product as well still the same problem. They reiterate and say upto 4 hours where they shud mention clearly that it will give backup upto 1 hour not more than that.One of the worst customer support services i have seen. The associates keep repeating the same sentence or copy paste the chat and dont provide solutions. Totally disappointed and waste of money. Never recommending anyone to buy their product.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31PfpEPlg-L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Value for money,Good,Perfect monitor for editing and casual gaming","I had an LG 27 monitor and broke it twice while wiping with cloth.. It couldnt even take my ring figure pressure. First time I repaired it with huge cost, but second time had to throw it.. Then I bought this one, slightly smaller as I was afraid not to pay too much. LG had inbuilt speaker but this one does not. There is no speakermike. The picture quality is good. I have a Dell soundbar for audiomic, so that is covered. The brightness is too much at 100 but I can reduce it to 40 which is good enough for me.The monitor includes power chord and HDMI Cable. It has a nice sturdy stand. The build quality is good. The Viewing angles are also good, with no glare from room lighting. Overall the picture quality is quite good.  The monitor also has eye care settings. There are couple of separate screws provided in a plastic cover, so be careful while unpacking. I had no missing screws problem.,I have been using for my personal and office work. Its a good product when you like to splitting the screen and work simultaneously in two different windows.The experience is far great,Came with the just the OEM package slapped with invoice but the product was safePros1. 24 inch screen pixels are small enough u can see it if u try but not bad2. Ips bleed is not there but there is definitely ips glow but not that bad3.75 hz but meh i cant tell the difference but again i have 120 hz phone so makes no sense to buy it for 75 hz4.colors are good movies and games pop out well5. Comes with a HDMI cable which is neat6. Build it good and angle of the monitor can be movedCons1,has like a slight yellow tint just like the redmi phone but u could get used to it2. 75 hz is a gimmick3. No display port which so bad4. Ips glow is there not much but dark things will look grey5.game mode is useless and eye blinding6.the power cable has a adapter with it which is pretty fragile if it break ur monitor is a brick VerdictI would say dont buy this just for the 75hz its not worth it i would be looking into benq and lg monitor or go big and get a higher refresh rate monitor i wouldnt say this was a waste of money but this definitely expensive for wat its offering,Pros1. Good display quality2. Thats the end of ProsCons1. WHY ON GODS GREEN EARTH THERE IS NO AUDIO JACK!!!!!What is the use of HDMI port if user cant get VIDEO AND AUDIO both2. IF SOMEONE IS INVESTING 10K ON A MONITOR WHY IN 2022 ANYONE WILL NEED A VGA PORT3. Build quality is questionable, Entire build is made of plastic which is fine but for me monitor was always a little tilted no matter how hard I screwed the stand it was still the same.4. AMD Freesync isnt much affective, you can still see screen tearing.5. Stand Movement is very stiff, I almost felt like I broke it. Just bad build quality.If you are only going to use HDMI port and find a workaround for audio then alright but for someone who games on PC and console both this is not good enough.If you are willing to sacrifice little bit of Visual quality and 15Hz of refresh rate which is not noticeable at all then go for BenQ, Same price but less hassle.OrBetter bump up your budget go for LG 24MK600M which goes for 13k or less but worth it,,It could have one more HDMI port, monitor for editing and casual gaming",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/417vDmMtbpL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Bass is also ok. Mic quality is also good in indoor condition. Receiver can clearly listen to you. I didnt use it in noisy environment or in outdoors. Company claims there is low latency while gaming,i dont know exactly if it works or not. Sound  call quality wise its good one..But the problem is with battery backup. Company claim it will give battery backup of 40 hours with case. 8 hours in single chargeAdditional 32 hours4 times charge via case This is misleading. It only gives total 25 hours playback. Ive tested it myself.It will give around 7 hours backup on single charge of buds  5060 volumeif you only listen to music or watching video,but no call or gaming You can charge the earbuds full only 2.5 times via case so additional 18 hours. If you try to charge after 2nd time it will only charge the buds around 60,then it goes off. After 1st charge the case has 48 battery left,2nd time it is down to 12,then 3 rd time it goes to 0They mentioned earbuds have 40 mah battery each,380 mah battery in case. It is mentioned in product manual,but in boat website it is written 400 mah instead of 380.Technically 40 hours backup is also not possible.It has 380 mah battery in case,it acts like a 380mah powerbank. So let assume its efficiency is 60. So it will give output of 228 mah.It is less than mentioned capacity due to energy loss  while energy transfer Now each earbud has 40 mah,so total 80 mah. Now buds can be charged via case 228802.85 times.Thats it.,Having bought this for roughly 1300, I must say that Im not too satisfied with the product in many ways.1. Pairing is very simple and it connects very quickly.2. The build quality is actually very good. Its all plastic but it looks quite durable as long as youre not too rough with it.3. Audio is decent, not too impressive. My wired earphones Boat Bassheads are quite frankly much better.4. THIS IS NOT FOR GAMING. I play Call of Duty Mobile and the latency is just painful. Even with Beast Mode turned on, I felt no difference as the the lag still persisted.5. The battery backup is actually great. The only positive thing I can think of is the battery backup. I got roughly 3 hours of playtime and the battery had drained from 100 to 80. The quick charge is a cherry on top.Overall, Id say its performance is very average. Definitely not worth 1300 in my opinion.,,Not adaptive for every persons ear. My wife doesnt suit the ear airdopes.  Partially satisfied. 799 rupees i bought. Dont bought more than 799 for this model.,The product was as good as i expected . The quality is good . Noise cancellation isnt quite high but overall good.,Battery lifespan i more, better audio. But calls are not audible properly some times.,It works best for the price. Sound quality is good, but plastic quality is average.,No clear sound on call.

So mild that it cannot be seen from a distanceThis power bank truly delivers as mentioned. I was able to charge my 17T phone 3 times fully with still some charging left in power bank. It took around 1.5 hours to charge my phone completely. Absolutely amazing product at offered price, you can go for this one. Also tried dual feature i.e. charging power bank  at same time charging phone and it works well no problem. Did not face any problem with power bank heating issue while charging phone or itself. Type C charging port for power bank is good so you dont have to carry two different cables and type A usb cables are hard to find.Few cons what I felt after using1. Charging cable provided along is of no use, it does not support fast charging. Hence used fast charging cable for both charging phone  pw bank.2. LEDs is of no use from a few feet distance. As they r so mild to be seen from a distance. You will have to hold PB very near to actually see LEDs. Although not a deal breaker but definitely 1 star deducted due to this.3. Bulky very bulky, definitely cannot be carried in a pocket. Not a deal breaker again.,This powerbank is the daddy of them all. Considering the amount of juice packed into it, its form factor is manageable. It holds a whopping 27k mAH of charge. Can reverse charge another powerbank. It charged up a 8k power Bank from 0100 in around 18min while it dropped from 10075. 4 LED indicators, indicating the quartile of charge left in the device is very useful. Ive not yet had to even once struggle to charge the device as even with heavy usage daily, I barely drop to 75 before I recharge it. It retains charge very well too.

Lookwise it does feel sturdy but depending on the usages it will show how long ot will last,At all stages one side of the stand doesnt fit properly.,Not that perfect, one side has a little gap,Quite satisified with the product after about 2 weeks of use. Value for the money. Ergonomics is satisfactory, but still it needs to be looked into. From the looks of it, it would have a long term durability also.,This is an awesome product that I have purchased till date for my WFH purpose. It can hold 14 Laptop very well. It can be adjusted for different heights. Grip to the table is really good. It helps to view the laptop with required angle. Easy to carry. Looks really great on a black table. Classic silver piece. Packaging is also very good.,3.5 starsI got this delivered today and tried it out. My laptop is 2.5 KG and 17 inches, a bit of a heavy machine.While the stand held my laptop, it did not fit properly. Because of the laptops weight or the size, the front of the laptop raises instead of staying on the padded notches. Have to move the machine forward a bit for it to stay on.If you want to use it as simply a stand  where you set the laptop and use external devices to use it like the mouse, gamepad or the keyboard, it is fine. You can go for it.If you want to use the machine itself when on the stand  touchpad and keyboard, you might face some issues. Using it directly is making the machine a bit wobbly.Will test it out with heavy work  gaming to see how the temperature holds. Might edit the review and the rating after using it a bit.,The product itself is awesome and in modern day where ease to carry and compact products are preferred it is a good choice , my only reason to give 4 stars and removing one out of five is the product latches linkagesarms that set the level of elevation angle  are bit free And can be undone from one of either side with a slight jerk while the second side latch supports all the weight in the meantime.,It is very convenient and compact to carry along with you.

It has Rubber grips, which makes it anti Slip on flat surfaces and feels sturdy in your hand.Here are few Pros and Cons u should know before buying. PROSLight weight and easy to assemble.Very Good for small devices.Stability is superb.Comes with Bluetooth remote.Quality of Rubber and Plastic is great CONSSize is quite small, it looks little bigger in the images shown. Not at all Suitable for Big DSLR cameras or video cameras. I think that the rotaion of the balls can become loose after several months of use. ILL Update here.Final Verdict  For the price of 400, It is a good product as it is quite useful when you vlog or want to take group photos. It will easily carry your Mobile phones and small cameras but DONT EVEN think of mounting your professional camera on it, it is very small compared to big cameras.Go for it!! Its a great product.,I basicly purchased it to record timeplace video but when I recieved it I was surprised because it was soo good at a less and affordable price but I gave it 4 stars because of the Bluetooth remote as it was unable to click photos and i even changed the battery but it didnot worked,Product is very good as compare to the price.Personal Opinion  A little bit quality of the material with a bit more size could have been improved.,Good But Could Be More Better.Cant Take Mobile WeightNeed To Adjust Stand Every Time For Single Click.,,This tripod is a good purchase. Pretty standard quality, i must say. Bluetooth remote also works perfectly. Not very suitable for hefty dslr cameras. Good for mobile phones and vlogging.,I m use this product from 1.5 year no complain,Learning needed",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41jOKzw6-EL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Double clicking within a month and scroll wheel scrolling in the reverse direction randomly.Edit 1The warranty requires you to take the mouse to their service centre which was a pain as it took me a while to find the nearest service centre and the address was incorrect. The service centre was helpful though as they replaced my mouse in a matter of minutes with no hassle. Will edit based on how the replacement works.Edit 2Replacement mouse working well so far.,This mouse feels and looks awesome, the slight rubbery texture feels premium and the build quality is also amazing, but the clicks seems to be a little sensitive. For regular use its amazing. Cant get better but for gaming, i would want a mouse with a little sturdier click, i click heavy during gaming and the mouse may take it but it remains in my head. So even for light gaming its fine where use of click is less as compared to fps shooting games.,It is an awesome upgrade for beginner level gamers, just changing mouse can actually improve your experience and gameplay. My boyfriend recommended this to me as we play Valorant together and my aim was persistently bad even though i tried so hard playing with regular Bluetooth dell mouse, changing from that to this piece was a great doing, 100 recommended if youre just starting to play anything like CSGOValorant or any other first person shooter game on regular basis.,i purchased it on16dec and i am writing this on 19dec and ill be honest no other mouse can offer this much quality in this price so if you can buy it just go ahead but but theres an alternative mouse by razer almost the same price razer deat ader i guess thats the name so you better check that one if rgb is not your priority yiu can choose that one bye....,Go for it,Design is easy to hold and there are extra buttons on right side which I find very useful. Its  size is perfect for my hand . Just one bad thing is after using for some time its surface become smoother or upper layer gets removed,Good mouse but Has poor wire quality,Its little big but the mouse is giving its best for gaming",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41zEY42v1tL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

The wheels provided with the heater are old and worn out. They do not rotate smoothly and there is difficulty in moving the heater.,A quality product which will keep you warm ,Not heating well. It works but radiation of heat is very low. I have other radiator heaters like Havells, Venus which hear comparatively much more for same power consumption. Will not recommend purchasing this.

It came out while adjusting...wastage of money,Nice product,Good,A Must Have product.,Poor sound,Wothy,Useful product if you watch movies in mobile.","Super product,Worst product,Too good product,Good,Since long I was waiting for someone to manufacture a simple mobile set of pocket radio size so that I could listen online stations with reasonable sound quality.  As we know  what ever qualities a modern mobile set may have, the audio produced by it is always dry with no bass content.  So either we have to connect it to a music system or have to use headphones which are harmful to ears in the long run. Recently when I was surfing internet I saw this product which looked like an old radio.  On verifying the details I found this fulfills my requirement and without delay I placed order.Zebronics Astra 10 is having excellent audio quality with sufficient bass and treble content  just  like radios of olden days. The hollow space around the speaker adds to the bass  effect.  If we rotate the set and make the speaker to face us, the sound becomes more crisp.  Even with full volume  sound does not distort.Bluetooth connectivity also is marvelous  and connects within no time and there are no breaks and delay in audio transmission.  Battery backup also appears to be good.  After fully charging once I am using it daily and after 3 days still it is showing 80 charge.  Though there is no provision to know the remaining charge in the product, the mobile from which we are connecting bluetooth  shows the details.Normally we can not expect much from FM Radio in such type of gadgets. But this product is exception for that.  By attaching a small wire to the whip antenna I could listen FM station situated 200 KM away as if was local one.Aux, USB and mSD card facilities also work well.But I felt the onoff switch should have been some what sturdy.  Long press type button would have been a better option. Also scanning of FM stations  should have been on long press instead of single press to avoid accidental scanning.Over all it is a great product.To give it a nostalgic look while enjoying online radio,  I used the picture of our old National Ekco Radios tuning dial as the home screen of the mobile.I use this for personl TV audio listening as well.Chidambar KakathkarMangalore,Poor sound quality,Worthy,You cant use it if the mobile is slim or more petite. I bought this for my mom her mobile is a slim model and doesnt have a case, and the mobile keeps falling if you tilt it. Overall it is a good product.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41uoxHxPDaL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Also, the steam sanitises the clothes making them odour free.The water tank is small and needs to be refilled again after about 2 clothes but bigger tank would have made it heavy and difficult to operate.Overall, good purchase.,Loving this product while using,It does the job pretty well.The cons according to me are 1. You cannot use it with clothes placed on horizontal flat surfaces. Because the water doesnt reach the outlet in the tank if the tank is half empty. The alternative is that the dress has to be hanged to a cloth hanger and then use the steamer.2. Be careful while steaming as it may burn the skin. Keep you palm at a safe distance while steaming the dress. This may be an issue when you try to steam the sleeves of the garment and also for flowing dresses.3. Not all fabrics can be completely wrinkle free.4. It sometimes leaves more steam and water at times leaving your garment with wet patches. The garment feels wet after using the steamer.5. You have to keep filling the tank twice for using it on one top.,Easy to use, sturdy, and does the job, only thing is that it takes time to cool, rest of all good,Its an amazing product and easy to use.

First about the product itself.  Its sound quality is very good. Bass lovers will just love it. Average mids and high.  It lasts about 2528 hrs with a full charge. Also tested on heavy rain while driving  dont worry , earphones were not plugged in.. . It was on my neck. But there was no water ingress.Now the major problem kicks in . After 10 months left speaker was not working. So , I registered a complaint on boat website. They picked my earphone for replacement.  But later it was replaced with  rockerz 255 pro  instead of  rockerz 255 pro   . Why  Even after a lot of conversations with boat support they didnt provide me my model . Now Ive to stick with these low quality ear peace. Hence ,Try to avoid boat online support for warranty claim and better visit physical service entre. Good luck.Edit  After having conversation with higher authorities on Twitter, they replaced the same with my model .Edit 2  from first day onwards after receiving the replacement product I was in doubt that the sound quality was decreased a lot. So, again I replaced with the authorized service centre for flat  no very low bass  sound.  But the 2nd replacement is also same. I thought Ive some issues with my ear lol  . But today when I listened to my friends rockerz 255 pro  same as mine but the retail unit I was surprised and thankful too . My ear was not damaged . It had the same punchy bass and that signature sound which was absent from my replacement unit.So, I can conclude by saying the replacement product will not have that signature sound as the retail unit.If anybody has experienced the same please comment.Thanks,I would recommend it very strongly if you want a budget friendly gaming earphone sometimes may feel a lag after purchasing but after some time it works very fine but it also has some cons like the build quality my earbuds gone worn off by normal daily use as well as there rubber quality is not that much good also mic it is not that good but it is okay so it is the best earphone under your budget....If aman gupta is watching this review you may gift me a earphone ,thanks to amazon for such good deliverance of the products,, i have been using amazon for long time and amazon have truely win the trust of the customer.

THE BEST,Good for the price.","Its been 15 days since i using the device extensively.I bought it on the Last freedom sale for Rs. 41,999  including 6k instant discount coupon.First let me be clear , I bought  S20 FE 5G with Snapdragon 865 , not  S20 FE with Exynos  and i am a user who uses phone most of the time .This review may be long but its worth to read it if youre buying this product.Let me divide between the Pros and Cons.First i would like like to start with Pros of the Device ,Pros 1. Display Samsung has been already popular for its AMOLED Displays but i saw some of the reviewers wrote about some display issues here . They might have got some defective Piece. I have no issues with my display . Its been long time i saw a great display like this ... with 120Hz it is Super Smooth.Also , it is very bright on outdoors and can decrease it to very low while using at low light conditions  PS  No tint issues The in display finger print scanner is very fast and didnt faced any issues with it .2. Stereo Speakers As an extensive multimedia user , this is one of the most favorable feature for me.Believe me , you cant find any other device with such great Sound quality in this price segment , its almost like flagship devices ..Both the speakers are adequately loud.3. Battery As a person whos shifting from a normal 60Hz Device phone , i was very worried about the battery life of this device at 120Hz but it surprised me very well ..Initially i thought i would need to switch to 60Hz for better battery life for daily usage.But I didnt even thought this device would give this much great battery life at 120Hz.At 120Hz , I am getting around 7 hours of minimum SOT  Screen on Time .The maximum SOT i got at 120Hz is 9Hours 13 minutes.I didnt checked battery life at 60Hz because i didnt use it at 60Hz even a single day . The battery life is Excellent.4. Rear Cameras I am not a very good photographer or something , i am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionally.I was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very well..Added Some Camera Samples above  Pic 1  Ultrawide , Pic 2  Telephoto  Pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading Both the three Cameras  Primary  Ultrawide  Telephoto  performs very well.If youre a camera guy you should definitely check this out.5. Performance  RAM Management Im not a gamer , I use my device for daily usage of social media , ott platforms , Calls , messages etc. but i use it extremely.I didnt faced any kind of heating issues with the device until now.Also ,Ram management of the Device is excellent , I am a person who uses 45 appsbackground at single time and i didnt have any issues of closing down the apps .6. ONE UI I was a stock Android guy , but One UI actually surprised me , it is very well optimised and very userfriendly for single hand usage..initial days i found it little hard to use the stock menu of one Ui but Im now got used to it.PS  I didnt found any kind of ads on my device as i didnt sign up or used any samsung Apps.7. Build Quality Even though its back is made up of plastic , the overall build quality is super Premium the Aluminium frame gives us a feel like using a flagship device..8. Future Proof   The device has 9 5G Bands , IP68 Rating , Wireless Charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracket.IP68  Wireless Charging are mostly only found on Flagship Devices . Its good to see samsung brings it at lower price.This is the best future proof device as of now.So these are the Major pros i noticed as of now .Now lets move to the Cons.Cons 1. NO HDR SUPPORT ON NETFLIX   As an extensive multimedia user , i found it very frustrating. even mid range devices offering HDR support on Netflix , Samsungs Flagship Killer doesnt have HDR support.IT WILL NOT BE FIXED VIA OTA UPDATE .2. No 256GB Variant   This is actually not a problem for most of the people but as a power user who uses Dual sim , i found it little difficult.But if youre a single sim user , luckily it have hybrid solution ..so you can use a Sim card  expandable memory card ...3. Gorilla Glass 3   Other competitors are providing atleast GG5 in this price range. But S20 FE 5G has just GG3  Which also Im not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere .But at the end of the day , GLASS IS GLASS  IT WILL BROKE.4. No headphone Jack   It is not any kind of unusual thing .most of the phones above 30K segment doesnt have headphone jack.So we have to buy 3.5mm to Type C adapter , type c earphones or bluetooth solutions .Note  Only Buy original Samsung type c adapter else it may not support.5. No 25W charger   It is not actually a con for me as i prefer Low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage .but it may be a con for you ,  Although the device supports 25W charging . Only 15W charger is provided inside the box .. They should have given 25W inside the box.I didnt have any issues with 15W charger but it would be great if they bundle it with 25W as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speed.For the reference of Charging speed ,Both 15W  25W will full charge the device almost at the same time but using 25W you can get about 50 within 30 minutes where as 30 with 15W charger.Full charge time i usually takes is 1hour and 35 minutes.6. Front Camera   I am not a selfie guy , but if youre a person whos looking for a selfie device just dont buy it . its not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but its not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price rangeCONCLUSION If youre a person who wants a device for normal day to day usage with good battery life , great rear cameras , great performance , better software support , better build quality and use it for more than 3 years  the cons mentioned above doesnt bother youJust buy it , I am sure you wont be disappointed.,Its been about 15 days since I got this phone.  I got it for 29990 on prime day sale. For the price its good.Pros 1. Camera.  Coming from Poco X2, the camera quality on this is amazing according to the price. It gives you good colours, contrast, focus, and everything that you want. It has OIS which is very apparent while recording. At 4k60 the stability is worse. But set it to  1080p60 and the videos will be amazingly stable. And the main advantage of OIS other than stable video is GREAT night mode shots. Hold the phone stable for a while and along with OIS you will get great photos with accurate colors and nice exposure. Attached samples.2. Display  Absolutely best. Samsung displays are the best. 120hz FHD. Flows smoothly.  Colors and calibration is top notch. Brightness is good but I felt its a little insufficient under direct sunlight. Its visible but could be better.3. OneUI  The main reason for upgrading to this phone was software. OneUI4.0 is the absolute best android skin right now. It has way too many customisations in it and lets you personalise your phone to a very high degree. Like theres a feature to read out the name of the person whos calling if your wearing headphones. It took me 3 days to fully go through all the settings and change them to my needs. Also Knoxx security is a special mention. Knoxx security is a software and hardware feature in samsung phones which protects your phone from all kinds of attacks and keeps your data safe. Even if it gets stolen you can remotely delete all your data. Secure folder allows you to store data in a separate storage. And many more such good features. While being a very feature rich and storage heavy skin, it still feels very very smooth and fast to use. Unlike MIUI or other skins, it doesnt stutter much and bugs are less.There are many other small pros like good stereo speakers. Nice premium build quality. Good data and wifi speeds. Other such features that you wont notice but definitely make a difference in your experience.Cons1.  Software.  I know I said its a pro but I say this in the aspect of updates.  This phone was launched in 2021 March in India and samsung promises 3 year android version updates and 1 additional year of security updates.  But theres a lot of confusion regarding if or not this phone will receive Android 14. It will receive A13 for sure. Theres a lot of debate on what they will do with14 because of global version launch date being earlier and yada yada. Basically the phones life maybe 2.5 to 3 years if they give a14.  But 1.5 to 2 if not. I researched on the Internet a few people say that it will receive a14 while I was few say its not. Its hard to say whos correct.  So assume its not getting a14 if you are going for it.2. Battery.  The battery on this phone is 4500mah and its good enough for a days use. But thats because I use it lightly. Not much online streaming. No gaming light social media and other usual stuff. If you use it even a tad bit more heavily, you will run out within a day. If youre going outside for the better part of a day,like a day trip to somewhere nearby,its better keep a power bank handy. In terms of Screen on time numbers, I once got 7 hours of sot on light usage, 1 hr YouTube and 1.5 hr streaming. I was at home and used wifi all the time.I got 3 hrs sot when I went outside for a day trip. I took many photos and videos and the phone shutdown before I could reach home. On a mixed use day,  you can get 4.5 to 5.5 hours of sot.Final verdict  The life of the phone in terms of Software Support is not great but you will get on time updates and almost no bugs in the software. So if you want to buy it you can and exchange it after maybe 2 years for other models. But if you planning on using it for longer than 2 years,  better avoid it. In the upcoming diwali and dussera sales,  the price might further drop to 25k even. I am just speculating but keep in mind your requirements and go accordingly.As always amazing delivery by Amazon.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ezRvTwcaL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

Pixel 6a.Unfortunately Indian markets doesnt have much of budget USB C earphones as its extremely limited in availability so my search gotten narrowed down to this one.Pros Works okayish for the price. Sound quality Average Call quality fairly good. I didnt had much complaints from the other side during phone calls. Tested when riding bike also, there were some wind noises reportedly. But still does the job. Buttons works well. Havent noticed any niggles thus far.Cons definitely not recommended for audiophiles as theres no distinction between highs, mids and lows. Sound quality gets muffled if volume raised above 70. bass is not that good. Its there, you can feel it but its not adequate and gets muddles out if the volume raised. Pls make use of your Eq app Poweramp Equaliser app, in my case to tweak up the settings to get noticed on its bass. Very mediocre performance of mids and highs too. Gets slightly better if tweaked with an eq app. causes pain in ears if used continuosly.If you are looking out for a decent budget USB c earphones mainly for calling, then go with this one. Works well for the voice calls,Its goodMic is not proper,I think this is the best c type headphone for this price segment. Sound quality, bass, meterial quality all are little above average so for RS.549 blue we can definitely buy without second thought.,Worked well for first two months. Now only one side is working.,I bought it to use with my Samsung S7 Plus which does not have any headphone jack. The bluetooth earphones work but when Im in bed on my side, they have accidental touch with the pillow or somewhere. So, I bought these USBC wired headphones. They work with my tab, which is good news. But the audio quality is average. It sounds tinny just like a 100rs headphones. Maybe that is to be expected because these earphones are cheap. So, I ended up not using them very often.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/313nBNJrT6L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

This is the initial impression of the product.,Ok ok product","Used for more than a month. Works HDMI, USB well so far. Not tested the MicroSD slots.,Build quality is great. Im using this with my MacBook it works fine . While using this adapter Amazon prime videos cant play in 1080p resolution on monitor it says the devices not support hd . Other ports are working fine not a problem.,I took this for my macbook m2 pro 2022 edition and it is working perfectly,all the ports are working fine till now ,its been 2 month i am using it , length of the wire is little small it could be little big and the price is also little high it could be under 900rs ,then it will justify.,If you bought a MacBook Air or Pro recently and wondering what to do about all the missing ports  USB, HDMI etc, this is your one stop solution.I tried on my MacBook Air M2 and it works like a charm. I connected, various pen drives, disk drives and a 128 go flash drive  all worked fine.Very reasonably priced compared to other options, yet has a fairly good look and feel.,Everything working fine but it doesnt works with Macbooks HDMI when try to connect one plus TV as an extended screen different displays on both but works fine if used as second screen with common display.,Solved my problem,I got the product on 11th August 2022. This is the initial impression.1 Packaging  The package I received was in good condition. it had a pre wrapped plastic on the box. No complaint about packaging but one thing to note is that No Brand name on the packaging. Although when you open the product , the brand name is there on the product.2 Build  Wire length is small to my opinion. It has a metal build finish and looks premium and sturdy. Wire quality is also good but at this price should have provided braided cable.3 I have tested this product with 3 usb ports connected  a Mouse b Keyboard cExternal 2TB SSD. SSD does not get disconnected when all 3 usb are connected. For confirmation i did a 2 gb file transfer and No disconnections were noticed.Note  The Speed of the data transfer is low. I did 2 gb file transfer and was getting the max speed of  39MBs with the SSD connected through the usb hub.Although when I did the same file transfer by directly connecting the SSD to the laptop port, i got speed of 111 MBs. So if you want to do lot of file transfer better connect it directly and not through the usb hub.So far initial impression are good, let see how long it last.,Sometimes not detected by MAC and quality is not that good",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41qTZXl3KaL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Samsung is always good,Value for money product","Before finalizing the AUE60 55, I visited Croma and Vijay Sales to check for the same TV or similar models for their features and picture quality. I was told AUE60  AUE70the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro are Ecommerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55 version. I liked the picture quality, and decided Ill get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save 20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70  I knew I wouldnt be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TVMi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.SoundPer other reviews  sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TVs speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.PictureThe Panels great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isnt greati.e. gray tones wont be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, therell be darker zones towards the edgescorners based on backlight placement. Blacks arent perfectly black  and theyre brighter than youd expect from a VA panel, but this isnt noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as Id like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40. 720p content is watchable from 8ft, 1080p is goodId say better than I expected, and 4K is well, 4K.ConnectivityI have a 35 Mbs broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fineI use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330  theres no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps  FeaturesHas all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed  Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV  YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar  which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support  which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99 of budget TVs in the market cant produce the contrast youd expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than nonHDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.RemoteVery basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remotes looks pretty sleek and stylish, but thats about it. Biggest gripe  typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, youll need to use the Dpad to navigate on an onscreen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsungs SmartThings App, but guess what  you cant even use your phones keyboard to type in when controlling through the app  this is something that can be added through an update, but its not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content.

The product is a bit tricky to setup with the app and you have to follow YouTube videos to get it setup. I wish Xiaomi provides video tutorial links in their user manuals. They dont mention it but we need Bluetooth and WiFi connection to be setup, for the app and robot  to work together. This tip is missing in user manual.2. WiFi connectivity does get lost sometimes but that is because my router is far from certain places in my house. That time the robot needs to be brought back to the WiFi range. 5GHz connection does not work with this model.3. The robot takes anywhere between 4060 minutes to completely vaccum my 800 sq. ft house. Battery life is really good in the new model. 50 or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house. Charging is also not bad. It took 1.5 hrs for it to charge full 100 the first time.4. Couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and I had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again. Once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for a couple of times, it would not repeat this behavior.5. Dusting is of A1 quality. Each time the amount of dust collected is staggering. We never knew we had so much dust in our house!6. Mopping is average. I would call it light wiping and not mopping. Hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping. Only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out. Adding a bit of floor cleaning liquid or Vim liquid in the water helps.7. Vacuum  Mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness. In this mode, mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick up.I recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles.8. Keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt, and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house. This is not ideal. So its important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping.9. The mop works horribly on door mats main door or bathroom mats. It gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place. So please remove all the mats, esp. during mopping session.10. Noise levels are pretty low in medium mode. Sometimes we dont even know where it has gone, it gets so quiet.Pros. Battery life Suction power Noise levels VacuumingCons Mopping is average. Its at best can be called as light wiping. Setup is bit tricky, user manual is insufficient. Xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home. You have to figure it out using YouTube videos. I can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing. Once the device is confused it doesnt correct itself automatically. It needs a map reset. Door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before mopping.Such tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your own.But I still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house clean.,ProsFor cleaning dust it is very good .we can set daily schedule.even if we forget to do so it will automatically does the work by setting schedule ...cleaning the box after its work is also not  very hectic..brushes are providing..We can set restricted areas.ConesMost of the hairs n threads are stuck through the round main brush.. little difficult to clear the brush.It has been more than 1 year iam using this.One time the movement is low .when ichecked..so many hairs are stucked in its wheel.it was little  difficult to clear the hair strands.Mopping it is average only..only takes very little amount of water.so oily things will remain in the floor..once or twice  in week we have to do mopping with plenty of water and lizol..It cant reach the sharp corners also.Once we create restricted area..by the time of using it couldnt detect the proper area we marked..so it enter those area and get stuck most of the times.it is main thing I hate about this product..remaining things are okay....then we have to reset the map and set restricted area again..it is bit annoyingOverall it is very good for me...my brooming is almost completely replaced by this ...once in week I do the complete cleaning with broom to all areas that didnt covered by this machine ..,In all other aspect like, price, battery,app feature, suction and cleaning its really very good product.I find it very useful and nice to have product.So will directly make note of  some drawbacksimprovent area, i observed.1 Sometimes it gets confused or leaves a specific section of bedroom even though there has been no obstacle.2 Its little noisy or I will say not a silent thing in standard suction power, though that with any vaccuum cleaner.3 Xiaomi could have provides extra Hepa filter with it.4 vaccummop doesnt clean properly and rather sticks dust to floor because of wet brush, so I do vaccum and then only mop subsequently is best option.5 Charging is super slow, if compared with any 5200mAh battery with mobile fast charger, its 10 times slower despite such, a big docking charger.,I am a bachelor and i do not like Maid coming to my house.this solves the purpose. It is great at vacuuming my 2000 Sqft house. It can do it on turbo mode with dual cleaning in single battery life. was surprised with the vacuum power and battery life. It collects way more dust than the manual brooming.It can skip corners and narrow places. Once in a while i just broom the corners and bring the dust in the middle before turning the robot on.55 for navigation and room mapping.Mopping is equally bad. Mop does not cover whole area and it leaves trails. it leaves the floor looking worse than the un mopped floor. Also water tank broke in just few cleanings.Recommended for vacuuming purpose.,Very good product. Very helpful product in my home.,We purchased the product in April and now it is not working.After charging it is running for less than one minute and getting stopped,Easy to use and Working well little bit of noise is there but acceptable.,Helping hand. More reliable than maids. Does the job well. Once in 4 days you need to mop yourself. Good suction power.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31grDt8hrBS._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

It seemed interesting  and had something called DIRAC Opteo in it  ANC. So I thought Id give it a shot.Firstday impressions  its blown me away!Exhaustive list of impressions1. DIRAC OPTEO Balanced sound with punchy bass! Yeah, and not booming bass. Its so great and Im quite surprised it sounds like something youd expect at a higher price point.  1.1 Soundstage As soon as the headphone is switched on, it starts in battery saving mode. Once you turn on DIRAC Opteo mode, you can literally feel the space opening up. All the instruments feel individual and sound separated. Fireflies by Owl City sounds lovely and all the strings sway in the centre while the various zaps and buzzes surround you. Its really great for the price!  1.2 Treble and Mids Clean and clear. The bass doesnt overpower them and feels just right. The vocals come out clearly and all the instruments dont interfere with it Drive home by Steven Wilson sounds great!.  1.3 Bass Punchy and tight. I love how it fizzles in Bonfire by Knife Party and how it reverberates in Turn Down for what by DJ Snake. Breakin a Sweatby Skrillex, Zedd sounded tight and I discovered how well produced it is! Lovers of tight bass, this is your product!2. Volume It gets really loud. So loud that I cant listen to it at the highest setting. But if thats your thing, then you should know that the highs get pretty shrill at the setting, but the bass is still pretty clean and loud!3. ANC ANC is present, but wont drown everything out. Its a great add on but if youre looking for a headphone to make all sounds around you zero, then this wont do that. If you need to drown out some noise while you listen to your tunes, this will do the trick!  3.1 Ambient Sound mode The opposite of ANC, it pulls in the outside noise to let you have a conversation. Again, you cant blast tunes at high volume and still have a convo, but you can listen with lower volume near 25 volume and hear things around you. If the ambient sound also increased as I increased volume, it would have been amazing.4. Calling Did a couple of calls. With nonoise, the other person said I sounded great! I took a couple of calls in a local grocery store was pretty loud and the other end had no issue hearing me.5. Buttons The button placement is easy and I didnt feel any issue getting used to the controls. The simple manual explains everything in 2 mins, so read once and youre good to go.  5.1 To note The sound is best in DIRAC Opteo mode. Every time you turn it on, you have to double press the multi function button to turn it on. Id have loved having it on by default. Also every time I turn it on, it plays a 34 second tune, which could have been shorter. Imagine hearing it every time you turn the thing on. Ugh.6. Connectivity Once I connected it to my phone the first time, it connects to my phone within 12 seconds of turning the earphones on.7. Battery It seems to last long! Ive been using them for about 4.5 hrs and its gone down about 20. Cannot say anything more yet though.  7.1 When you take both the earphones out of your ears, it doesnt auto pause like some of the competitors. Annoyed that this was missed, would have saved so much more battery if they did this.8. Build quality I have a black version. Its made with good quality plastic and didnt feel heavy around my neck. It doesnt have metal anywhere, and its quite simple. I think it looks decent.9. Exercise Need to test! Will update later.In summary, an easy recommendation. If you can overlook the small issues, theres a great sounding, featurepacked and long lasting device here at a great price! 1010 would definetely recommend!,First I was bit sceptical about the build quality but have to say its got a pretty sturdy material and decent quality buttons, bass is good, vocals are much clearer in Crystal bionic mode, ANC is working to a degree will definitely cancel out the noise of your celing fan but dont except any more than that, no issues with call enx is working upto its name, battery is sufficient around 1214 hours if you mix up the modes.. Overall a decent all rounded neckband, jack of all and king of none.,All other things such as sound quality, battery backup are very good but multiple device pairing is implemented very poorly. If I connect with laptop and try to connect with phone at same time. It does not work many times. If headphones are connected to laptop and you close the laptop without shutting it down then you wont be able to connect with phone again unless and until you disconnect with laptop. This is a big bug. Please fix this.,This BoAt 330 ANC Neckband is very Good but needs improvement and fixes.Pros Nice Sound Quality while using Crystal Bionic Sound, but its average on normal mode which feels a little more bassy and losses clarity at certain points. Great Build Quality Its ANC  Ambience mode is good in this price range. Its quite Comfortable to wear for long sessions as per my ear fitting. It has Dual Pairing which is very good but its not very seamless and there is a small issue with dual pairing, e.g., while receiving a call on one device, the audiovideo being played at another device wont Pause you have to manually pause instead there wont be any sound output through that device. Its a little issue but it would have been great if the video gets paused while receiving a call on another device, as this is available on BoAt Rockerz 335 and a few different BoAt Neckbands.Cons Its range is very low considering Bluetooth v5.2, I even have BoAt neckband with v5.0 which has better range. Even a single wall coming in between 34ms can block the sound output. Its battery life is average which needs charge every day if you use it for roughly 810 hours everyday with Bionic Crystal ModeANC enabled. While using Dual Pairing sometimes there are sound drops and lags in between. And the sound gets high pitched and starts lagging sometimes if you switch quickly between devices. This happened on the Replacement unit I received, maybe its not the case with your unit. Sometimes no sound is received while playing Audio from both devices. I dont know if its wrong with my unit or every unit.Overall this is a good and considerable Neckband under 2k if you want Good BassRich Sound Quality, ANCAmbience mode and Descent battery life.But if your requirements mostly is Dual Pairing, then this is not for you. As I bought this considering Dual Pairing feature most importantly. But its not really seamless in between Devices, but still its the best possible available feature in this price range or even under 5k but it needs improvements and fixes to make it more seamless and efficient.Another problem with Dual Pairing is that the media doesnt gets paused on first device if theres a call on the second one, which is already there on BoAts few other Neckbands, but then there is no MediaPause feature on them. e.g., If audio is being played on 2 devices first device Audio will get paused if Audio is played on second device and viceversa.So do try it out by yourself. Because its my personal experience with the Neckband, maybe you get a better experience.Thanks for Reading. Happy Shopping!,Bought this one after using Rockerz 255 pro for over 2 years now. Comparing this with that, that one was ergonomically better, felt snug in ears.Standalone review of this.1. Noise Cancellation is just alright, not too great, not too bad.2. Sound Quality is definitely great and excellent with the Bionic Sound feature. Kudos on that part.3. Bass Quality is fairly good at this price point.4. Holds charge for as long as advertised.5. Overall bulky nature of the neckband puts you off and then the finish is poor too around the control buttons making it look very tacky  cheap atleast on the funky grey one which I bought because it was priced lowest.ConclusionGood Product at a Fair Price i.e. Nothing too great but nothing bad either.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31gzRr9mIaS._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

The batteries packed separately inside leaked.,Wonderful, but ...,Good but its plastic,Good for now.,Awesome product,Value for money,ONE IN A MILLION","Just received, as of now looks good in this price range. Will use it for few months and update the review.,Batteries has leaked inside the packing. Had to put new ones,Wonderful scale, means great look, good accuracy, very lightweight and skinny and easy to store, and very easy to clean.So far so good, BUTThe durable 304 stainless steel construction is just a half true promise. Only the top plate is obviously some metal but the body is also obviously plastic.Would not even mind about this little deviation between promise and reality, we all know how marketing messages have to be read, but the durable stainless steel top plate fell apart from the remaining plastic part of the machine after not even 4 months of use. Seems it was simply somehow glued on top with 4 glue strips, and the glue doesnt work anymore due to whatever reason didnt remove it, it just fell apart during vertical storage, just so after only 4 months of use. Weighting still works when I press the metal plate correctly back on top but as soon as I store it, the plate separates itself again from the other part. Assembling that thing again and again for every single use is a pain i.t.a. and not what I expected.Thats why I give finally another brand a chance, after I complete my review. This time no more durable stainless steel construction wanted ... let me try a different construction, which is even some hundreds of bucks cheaper than this thing here both prices 60 reduced today.

Lov my coffee made in this! This should be advertised as suited for 4 cups not 6.,Does the job well and even after placing directly on the stove there is no discolouration. Steel quality is upto mark.,I have been using this product for a while and have no complaints. Makes amazing filter coffee.,Looks and quality are at par with other brands in its price bracket. In function, this kind of a mokapot design is flawed at the cleaning aspect, including this particular model, in my observation. In it, the pressured boiling water pushes through the coffee powder in bulk together, thus rendering the flavour inferior to what is brewed otherwise when the water percolates little by little. Secondly, the portafilter type coffee powder container, positioned just above the boiler chamber, sends some dissolved coffee back to the boiler water through the upward pressure pipe, rendering the entire remainder water mixed with coffee go waste. Thirdly, the coffee powder containers gasketted mesh is sedimented too while filtering the forced brew upward. So, when a person like me thinks of preparing a brew in a mokapot like mechanism, the very thought of the predicament of dismantling the the tiered chambers, separating the gasket, and then wash the pot thoroughly, because coffee is lurking everywhere therein to cause unhygienic residues, dampens my desire to go for it. I am no debater if the idea is to leave the pot just rinsed and washed and not rid it of the residues. All this is not the case with the downward filteration method of the other types of coffee machines that are absolutely unmessy. No offense meant for any system, this is my personal opinion.,I like the convenience of making coffee for 23 people in one go.Its very easy to clean it up after every use. Its rust free and looks beautiful while kept on kitchen counter even idly,Like and good product,Ordered this for my stay in India.  it worked the way it should be, it has silicone washers, easy cleaning.  Product quality can be improved.  OK product.  not WOW!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/414gUKUBHML._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

But this is does not catch fingerprint at allIf u pay 500 INr higher u will get the spigen ones which protects the front sensors tooHappy with my purchase and moving forward will be applying spigen screen guards for all my products,This is hands down THE BEST screen protector for iPhones.

Instalation was pretty easy.What i would have liked1. Had it had a black bezel so it blends well with the phone so that no one could make out that a protective tempered glass is stuck.2. Had it also covered the front camera like the ESR protective glass does, it would have been better.3. Would have appreciated a price around 500, definitely overpriced.,Super easy to install. The screen guard got attached without any hassles and was perfect fit. The EZ fit tray works like magic.,I used this product for my iPhone 13 Pro with a peak design phone case. The quality of the screen protector is excellent and the engineering concept used for the installation is the best Ive ever seen. They even include useful tools and guidelines to minimise the possibility of error.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Usew0lrWL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

"Esquire Laundry Basket Brown, 50 Ltr Capacity",Crafted with care|It is designed keeping your choice and requirement in mind|Hassle-free usage,"I would have given it 5 stars.. but..,Quality product,Good product,Good,Good capacity but looks a bit cheap,Medium size,Affordable,Basket is good, problem is with the lid.","I was very impressed by the quality of this basket  I found it sturdier than Cello brands laundry basket. I ordered one more basket in black but unfortunately the finish of the product on the inside wasnt smooth. I wanted to store washed laundry in the second one but the baskets interior didnt have a smooth finish  had scratches and plastic sticking out that could damage delicate clothes. I returned the second one. I am deducting a star because my second purchase experience wasnt good. I might buy the same product again in the hope that I get a product of the same quality as my first purchase.Update after ordering the basket for the third time  The third baskets rim was bent so I couldnt fit the lid but the baskets finish was perfect. I persevered and requested and exchange and on the fourth attempt, I finally got a good quality basket for storing washed laundry.,Plastic quality is good sturdy build overall good purchase reasonable pricing,Cover could be fit better, capacity but bad finishing and bit pricey. Cheap quality too.,Good but not any packing,It does the job. The capacity is huge and you can easily store 1 weeks laundry. The top is detachable,The lid of the basket is not that strong and ite just comes out all the time and I have to fix it again and again.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41svI04SS1L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Not easily knocked down by kids. No fear of falling over.Mobile holder stand is very flexible, easy 360 degree rotation.Mobile holder also pretty tight., very safe to keep the mobile.The adjustable clamp is wide enough to suit any width  you can fix it on very slim or thick surfaces. Holds well.Easy to assemble according to the instructions given on the website.Overall, very satisfying.CONS A bit tight when it comes to the gooseneck clamp. So quick adjustments to length may not be possible while watching.. But that adds to the sturdiness. So thats okay.The mobile holder also is a bit tight to insert the phone and remove. But again, you neednt fear about the mobile loosening and falling off.,For the price it is the best, its hard but without hardness it cannot withhold a weight of tabletSo the the hardness makes sense,Not bad its okaysVery nice product bro value for money but you ask the store in this product how much other ways the quality and material are good,Better for streaming videos because if you fit your phone in this and then touch it then it moves due to the weight of phone or use this for any work where you dont have to touch your phone frequently such as video calling or voice calling etc.  Otherwise its good,Very useful for students for their online study, aslo useful for movie lovers.,Using for Kindle on bed. Quite sturdy and good clamp. Length of wire should have been slightly more by 9 inches which will enable user to hold the mobile Kindle at a good distance.,The length is not great but the product is perfect for its prize and solves the purpos, using it as a bed arm,Works well enough, it isnt really stable and tend to vibrate and shake when holding tablet and some heavier phones.Also I can only hold phone horizontally, that means it gonna block charging ports and speakers.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41bFp+Wev+L._SY300_SX300_.jpg

The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch. Moreover, it has builtin Amazon Alexa support, SpO2 tracking, stress tracking, and much more. Coming in a budget segment, is it worth it Should you buy this smartwatch If you too have such queries, then there is nothing to worry about. It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it.ContentsBox ContentDesign, Build  ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy NowBox ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in blackgold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign, Build  ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.Boat Xtend design and buildI personally dont like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also dont look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.Boat Xtend designThe watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.DisplayComing to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you wont notice the bezels, and the screen quality wont feel cheap at all. It doesnt have an alwayson display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.Boat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isnt something that we can complain about in this price range.Watch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the poweroff button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isnt much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you wont find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done costcutting in terms of the processor, thats why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.Boat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time, heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.Boat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an inbuilt microphone, and you can access it by longpressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you wont find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you wont prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it wont be a problem.Boat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.Boat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You wont be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I havent noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitnessrelated options and all the watch settings on the app itself.Boat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.Boat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I dont find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.Boat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.Boat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 34 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.Final WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didnt like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 23 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000.,Pros1. Premium build quality with matte finishing sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.2. Heart Rate except heart rate spikes in weight training, Pedometersteps counter are accurate but SPO2 is off by  2 when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time  wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.3. Large 1.69, clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times  after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 0203 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity7m. The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.7. Definitely splash proof though didnt take the risk of submerging the watch.8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.11. Boat Wave app connects easily  no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.12. Training, Sports modes r good.13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.14. Find my phone works well.15. Extremely stylish, light weight  comfortable for all day wear.16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.Cons1. Lacks vibration intensity control.2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But cant figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands  gestures to click pics.3. No quick reply messages for notificationscall alerts.4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97. But this is common in all smart watches.6. Battery doesnt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.11. No calling feature. But it doesnt matter as most dont want conversations to be public.12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band 22 mm is a bit wide.13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with IndoorOutdoor combi of 4 sports Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling.15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour the evergreen, classic goldblack. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor.,,Plz add calling feature with this,Otherwise it is ok,Good,Its little expensive but okkk,",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41pfjyUPZLL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I dont find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.Boat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.Boat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 34 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.Final WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didnt like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 23 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000.,Pros1. Premium build quality with matte finishing sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.2. Heart Rate except heart rate spikes in weight training, Pedometersteps counter are accurate but SPO2 is off by  2 when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time  wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.3. Large 1.69, clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times  after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 0203 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity7m. The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.7. Definitely splash proof though didnt take the risk of submerging the watch.8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.11. Boat Wave app connects easily  no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.12. Training, Sports modes r good.13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.14. Find my phone works well.15. Extremely stylish, light weight  comfortable for all day wear.16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.Cons1. Lacks vibration intensity control.2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But cant figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands  gestures to click pics.3. No quick reply messages for notificationscall alerts.4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97. But this is common in all smart watches.6. Battery doesnt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.11. No calling feature. But it doesnt matter as most dont want conversations to be public.12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band 22 mm is a bit wide.13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with IndoorOutdoor combi of 4 sports Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling.15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour the evergreen, classic goldblack. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor.,,Plz add calling feature with this,Otherwise it is ok,Good,Its little expensive but okkk,",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41pfjyUPZLL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Works with two devices,Positive review Almost good and useful,Hissing sound  output from viSe TV Vijay sales.,Acceptable sound, no hassle of charging,Excellent product,Not good range,Very good","Atlast  I connected successfully. Working good. But sound volume  clarity not adequate. Durability, to be assessed.  Dear amazon.in, tell the seller to write connecting procedure clearly.Manual printing also is bad. I had to struggle.,Does what it says. Works well to connect two Bluetooth devices to any other device like a laptop, smart TV, etc. Can take a bit of time to pair two devices. But the manual in the box helps.Sound quality over aux cable too is good. So, even if you do not have a digital output or RCA you can still use it. Bit bit flimsy and delicate. But then you dont need to move it around everyday.,Disadvantage  the sound and video lag with distance while connecting Bluetooth with headphones.Pairing with headphones difficult need to wait longFeels volumes low.,,I got this to addon to a highend system, which traditionally doesnt have the facility. However its often requested when guests come over. I was using a Phoenix transreceiver, but the constant need of charging and the single indicator LED made it difficult to integrate into this kind of application. The optical out is connected to a dual ESS9028 DAC, and the device used for transmission is the iPad Air.This lacks a battery, which is a big differentiator. This means it is not exactly portable, and the form factor reinforces that feature. It is intended to be a desktop unit, and it comes with a reasonable set of cables. The quality of the included cables is quite poor, so its best to use something else.Compared to the direct input from USB, the overall sound is poorer, with a shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble. Still, this is being used in a highend system  I suspect with many lesser speakerampDACs it will be acceptable. At maximum output, the level is about 12dB lower than a direct USB connection to the DAC.It is around the same as my Signature Acoustics unit, which is 13rd the size but uses a battery, and doesnt have a volume control or the bypass feature, or the nice display which is handy if you are close by.The bypass is one of the highlights of this device, it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough, and allows you to use both BT and another optical sourcereceiver  though only either can be used at a time.The build quality is average. It is lightweight enough that a set of decent cables will tip it over backwards, hence the thin cables supplied. The onboard volume control is nice, if a bit redundant given everybody uses their handheld or other device to control volume I use the DAC remote. It also has only 16 clicks, so the control will be very coarse. The display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low, it is sufficient for the tasks.Overall, its quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices. The sound quality limitations of BT transmission compulsory resampling and lossy compression, among others cannot be overcome even with the fanciest devices and protocols, so Id rank it close to the top of what you can get as an addon for a hifi system. For more normal usage, there are cheaper options available.,Excellent product,Bluetooth range is very less,Bought it to connect my old Sony 5.1 blueray home theater with MI 4k box which does not have Optical sound port. It has an spdif optical port which can connect to the home theater optical in",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/315GvM3Qq6S._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Right Click BT Icon in TaskbarAdd Bluetooth Device.AudioVideo Device then Search for the BT Device...Now when you connect give it about 10 seconds then once connected it should provide the Stereo mode under Speaker icon in Taskbar. Once you disconnect, depending on any other Headset you will have to go back to these settings and Disable Content Protected device.

Either will connect to the device. Once it is Connected, give about 10 to 15 seconds for Windows to recognize the Connection. You will see what the options are in next description In the taskbar click the audio profile speaker icon Here there are 4 options that pop up for me Noteif you only see 2 or 3 then read the section above that says SOME HEADSETS may not work properly TV sound, Laptop speakers, Bluetooth Audio Renderer Stereo and Bluetooth Hands Free Audio Mono.Click on Bluetooth Audio Renderer Stereo wait a few seconds for it to comply.Now your headset should be connected.In watching Youtube I do get some lag but with different headsets the lag increases or decreases.The same with me using VLC or Windows Media Player. Sometimes if I stop the video app and restart then it will be no lag.I dont use ZOOM,Teams,Skype, so I cannot test how the mic setup would function.Any one that has any input for this please use any or all of my post and add to it. This would be helpful to alot of people.FIRST post So for a few months I was using it strictly thru Win10 utilizing Win10 drivers and bluetooth connection page thru SettingsSystem. But a few times i tried to use with music streaming to Sony XB400 or Oneplus Buds Wireless Bass edition and there would be intermittant drops. Also when it came to pairing and connecting it would consistanly slow down my HP AMD A6 chipset laptop. Also anytime I took the dongle out it would also affect disconnect my thumbdrive. So I assumed it was a throttling going on with my USB ports. I have Sandisk Dual Drive, WD Passport, DVi to HDMI and Logitech dongle. So one by one i disconnected everything and left the BT dongle and it was a little better.So I checked the TP Link India site for any FAQ related. When I searched in the DownloadsDrivers section there was software driver present.  So I downloaded, installed it and Win10 taskbar shows BT icon to use theBT Dongle. The Driver software is by CSR Harmony Wireless Software Stack Version 2.1.63.0.Once installed there are more options that can be accessed thru the BT icon in taskbar. The BT icon sits in the system tray as before. Audio transmission can be switched between stereo and mono. Also if your playing a video or audio file and you start the pairing process once connected there will be slight pause then it connects to the output in stereo. It works really well, I purchased a long usb male to female cable and now i have a little bit more increase in connection distance. I have not tried this for transfer of files. If and when I find a need to do so I will update.for now, at this price point it gives me freedom to connect my BT audio gear instead of purchasing a more expensive unit to give my laptop BT capabilites. and this is as small if not smaller than some thumbdrives. Oh and I also purchased a seperate QZ Powered USB hub for my drives. So the only USB devices connected are the Dongle, and the hub. Now when I disconnect the BT dongle my drives stay connected.I hope this information is helpful, I tried not to make it too long but it happened. If any questions arise please drop me a line and I will respond with whatever help I can give.,TP link products usually work well...while longevity with continuous use may vary, but these devices are not intended for prolonged or continuous use..I have had multiple to link devices ranging from wifi adapters, routers, range extenders, etc..Now I have tried this Bluetooth adapter..ProsMinuscule size, you can keep attached to the device, not noticeableBut not recommended to do so..as its usually set to discoverable during setup and it has decent range..so if one is too skeptical, might lead to security issues.. although the hacker will have to be in the same house probably!Range is decent..works good in the same room..this kind of device is usually meant for local connectivity, usually without barriers...I use it to connect headphones to the PC and it works nicely for that..I earlier had a Bluetooth 2.0 adapter from enter and that worked well too, except for the range and bandwidth required nowadays has increased..so some choppy audio did occur with todays high quality audios and that got managed with this Bluetooth 4.0 adapter..nice clean audio..Lastly, it works nicely with Linux..i use debian based Ubuntu..and its almost plug and play..I did have blueman Bluetooth manager installed from the previous adapter I had.. And when I plugged it in..i didnt have to do anything else..So unlike what the site says, about only windows, it definitely works with Linux..I cant say if the 5.0 version UB500 will work though...While installing the driver in windows, I noticed it was installing CSR stackAnd CSR original chip  there are many fake ones is known to work with Linux..so maybe thats why it worked well..Coming to windows, i have win7.I had bluesoleil preinstalled, and it worked with it.Didnt have to install any driver separately..But there is a driver available in their site for xp7..In win8 and above, its supposed to be plug and play..So no issues there..Now the consA bit high price than rest of the companies.. probably can improve on that....i bought it for 400Audio quality is good, but somehow, compared to my enter Bluetooth 2.0 stack..The audio was a bit muted..had to increase the volume higher to reach the same level of loudness..but even then, i feel, a slight reduction in the dynamic range of the audio.. no idea if thats a software or hardware issue..encodingdecoding issue..Its not very noticeable.. specially of someone doesnt have anything to compare with..Lastly, the windows driver is 400 MB!granted it has both 32 and 64 versions..but each one is almost 200 MB!Thats way to big for a driver of these devices..Neither bluesoleilblueman cross 30MB..So I dont know what is being packaged in those drivers..Also, somehow the driver didnt have a clean install in my system, something to do with incorrect loading of c library...It didnt matter as I already had another driver installed..Overall a nifty little device.I have no need for 5.0 Bluetooth as i dont have any device that requires it..I just needed a 4.0 adapter to solve the bandwidth problem..and that purpose is nicely served and that it works both in win and linux is very helpful..Does the job well, few consHence one star less..,Using it for 2 weeks. Just plug it , install drivers and you are good to go ! Seem less connection with ps5 controller! Latency is very low around 1ms . So basically connection is even faster than wired connection 2ms .  But when I simultaneously connect airpods gen 2 the sound output was very weak , it was muffled! But it serves my main purpose with ps5 controller .,Apparently, it seems like its the most relevant Bluetooth adapter out there good connectivity and all sort of stuffs like that, generally comes in a BT adapters Id say the only con is the installation part it took a while figure out which was their website and drivers of ub500 aside from this everything is fabulous.,Very easy to install, connectivity is also good but sometimes while using Bluetooth earphones sound cracks also Bluetooth sharing is quite slow .....thats allOtherwise th product is very good,1 Easy to install, I mean just plug in .2 Connectivity is on all point but 12 time i feel fumble issues.3 sound quality is all depends on your wireless speaker.,If you are tight budget, its okay then. Otherwise if can spend 150 extra, go for BT 5.0 version. Much better in both range and connectivity.,Like",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31TZq2dY-hL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Bluetooth v5.1: Experience lag-free usage, thanks to the industry-leading Bluetooth v5.1.","Updated decent tws for under 1k,Sound clarity.,Good Product,Buds are very good Quality.,Nothing,Budget Friendly,Amazing sound,Good product...","Updated  Overall you really get what you pay for. They serve the purpose of a decent pair of tws for basic quality calls and music listening. Main problem I noticed was with the pairing and connection strength as they routinely lose signal for no apparent reason. Once or twice I had issue of only one of the buds getting paired and had to reset the other one to get it paired.If you have paired these to one device and try to pair to another one without disconnecting from first it simply doesnt work. This is starting to get annoying but maybe Ill get used to it. Well see.This is just day 1 review of these. Got them for Rs 898 on some offer on Amazon. Ill post updates later on. Hope this is helpful for anyone interested.Package  The packaging is quite decent for such a low price. Comes with the tws earphones fitted with medium earplugs fitted inside the case. Also included are a very short USB c cable and two additional earplugs  small and large. Package includes some Noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction card.Build  was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting. Will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded. The earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand. They fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the case.Comfort  This is very subjective and each ear is different. Its one of the reaonss I wanted to get a cheap tws to see if Im OK with the form factor for long hours. The prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so I switched to the small size ones. And after about 20 mins I forgot I was even wearing them. The earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they dont cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use. One thing to note is that if you have Gandhi ears then the fit might be a little awkward  I should know. My ears covered the touch areas of the buds so I had to fiddle around a bit if I wanted to do any of the touch actions. YMMV.Sound quality  I liked them. Im no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation. I tried my usual test at  and they fared quite well. The treble maxes out at 15khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point. There was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below 30hz but the L and R drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent. I feel this definitely punches above its price point.Call quality  In a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good. There was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear. But things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like youre inside a well. Seems the mics cant figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality. Overall you get what you pay for here.Range  max I got was around 5m. Not sure how they tested and got 10m as advertised. Any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so I guess thats passable.Pairing  UPDATE on 12th Aug 2022       Major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone. You have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again. Had issues like only one of the buds pairing as well.Have to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenient.I dont have a phone to test the fast pair features  Actually Im not even sure these support it. Anyway, the earphones go into pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case and I was able to pair with no problems on multiple phones. They will auto pair post this initial setup to previously paired devices. I could not find any way to control the pairing mode though. You have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does. They switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved a little.Battery life  Way too early to tell anything. Will share my experience post one week and one month. But they came around 80 charged in the box and I have stated to charge the case  Box says it will take 2hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like a flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done. The earphones also have LEDs that blink red  white to indicate pairing, low battery etc.Sync issues  None so far. But have seen many such reports and reviews wherein the L and R earphones seem to go out of sync on similar low price TWSes. So will see if I face any such problems.These are the primary areas that I am concerned with while evaluating any TWS so will share how my experience is after a while. So far Im happy with them.,Hi, My name is Akshay.I used this product and this is very good in sound and valuable money.good in calling also.everything is perfect.,Good Sound Quality...,Buds are very good Quality. With great noise cancellation feature.,When we received this order box is already opened like this.I was not expected at all.,what i dont like is the earpads, sometime it came out dont know the reason even i tried different fits. Rest is great.,Amazing sound,It is the best choice for the product",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31oumlyiGiL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Secondary, Iam a big fan of Sony and LG brands., Thirdly,as I have 4 year old kid at home I was so scared to spend money beyond 15k. Ofcourse at the first day sale for prime members when the Amazon great Indian festival started, I saw one Plus and Hisense A6H were priced at under 20k including bank offers and my favourite Sony 43inch was priced at 35k. But discarded Sony just bcz of expensive and scared if my kid whilst playing will break it. So I was continuously searching for budget friendly TVs like TCL, Redmi Nokia and Iffalcon but didnt like the 32 inch TV. Suddenly out of the blue on Thursday that is on 20 October I saw this blowing offer on Hisense Vivid 4K TV but scared to buy, but I felt offer was tempting so took the risk and bought it for 15,740  deal price 20,990... ICICI Bank credit card instant discount 5,250 so technically bought it for 15740 so I felt worth the risk and bought it. On 22nd October TV was delivered to me and immediately I raised installation request and technician came on 23October and installed the TV.Thats my journey from searching to installation.Now coming to initial impressions.1 Picture  Id say being a VA Panel, I can clearly see blacks are not so deep they are bit of greyish kind, however, colours are not over saturated, I felt they are normal and when I looked at TV from sides I can clearly say it doesnt come near to IPS panel display. But, yeah for an average user like me its sufficient.2 Remote Its simple, major apps hotkeys are given. YT, Amazon prime video, Hotstar which is good. voice assistant is enabled. Simple and user friendly experience. It lacks hands free Google assistant.3 Sound I personally felt if 30 Watts audio given in the TV it would have been great, but only 24watts given which is crisp and clear though I increased volume upto 70 to chk, but no distortions nothing its clear dialogues and Bass, but if a soundbar is added it will be added advantage.4 UI It comes with Android 9 it doesnt matter to me as Im a very average user so runs the show for me, I hope Hisense sends the OTA update5Now to the main point as u can see my pictures, I see specially in Amazon prime video app, on the blue screen there are some lines which I dont know whether its problem with panel or application. Need to chk with Amazon customer service for the reason. If any user can help or enlighten me on this issue that would be super.6 Conclusion  Frankly speaking i bought this TV only bcz I got it almost under 15000bought for 17520 including extended warranty for 22 years bcz even if some mishap happens when the kids playing it wont pinch me . So from my perspective I felt its okay with some minor issues like sound. I just need to get clarity on that prime video issue. If that is sorted I will be happy.Happy Diwali to team.,I have bought this tv at 18,990.00 and at this price tag its a great purchase.picture quality is good not at per with sony or lg 4k tv but better than its rivals like mi redmi VU etc. VA Pannel works fine and gives good amount of blacks.ProsAndroid TVSoundColourConsRemote,Loved the picture quality,Average picture quality but ok for this price,Worth for the cost. Nice quality and clarity,Good,Good product,Good support team as unit reached within 11 hours installation done within time of installer called. Demo properly given.

The software is sweet and simple but some more features can be added.  Thats it, get it soon before the stock runs out ,Must have mechanical keyboard for your typing and gaming needs. The keys are hot swappable. No drivers needed just Plug and Play. Must Download the software if you want a specific RGB colour or transitions and macros. Excellent built quality. Swiftly delivered from Origin Shop in 4 days. Price is justifiable. For people using the UK layout keyboard, press ShiftEND key for , press  key above return key to type . Use FnWASD keys for navigation. Cheers !,too small for my hands.I recommend the keys little more spaced and big for easy clickingThanks, for reading my review.,This is my first mechanical keyboard and Im so happy with this. Apart from the lights, I like the sound the keys make, the quick response and swift keys. Id recommend it for people who might want to switch to the mechanical keyboard.  Also, the grey and white colour is awesome!,,,The quality of the keyboard is goodThe sound n keys r impressiveThe main point is the RGB which is excellent with soo many RGB modes which is always controlled by the software and the brightness is the best.If u r looking for a red switches mechanical keyboard and you love rgb go for this one... But its 60 keyboard, if u r a coader or needs arrows key ig you should choose something else but if non of problems u have just go for it,Using it from last 4 monthGreat value for moneyGreat lightsThey provided extra switches also which was lifesaver for me i changed 2 switches in kb cuz W key and backspace was brokedEasy to MoD",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41nRBNNDnNL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Xiaomi has already released home security cameras using other brands such as Yi. And the home security camera market is yet to be adapted in large. So, you can expect a lot of misunderstanding on how everything works together in a home security camera in general.Initial setup It is a breeze for some, but pain for others. See the 1star ratings if you want proof. I had trouble getting this camera recognized by its own app Mi Home. It took about 1 hour to recognize after trying with different lighting conditions. The camera got disconnected from the app, after I switched the SSID of the router. So, I had to pair it again. This time, it took more than a day! of trial and error. I had to keep the camera under bright sun light in order to get recognized by the Mi Home app. Lesson learned in a hard way.Bandwidth requirement This camera requires 24x7 connectivity with solid internet connection and with good upload bandwidth. Even if you have 100mbps connection, this camera can only be connected via wireless. So, longer the distance from the router, shorter the bandwidth. This camera hangs up, if it doesnt have enough bandwidth. If you add NAS storage, youd need even more bandwidth between the camera and the router. The camera is very sensitive. If you set up any conflicting configurations, itd just hang and would not record anything at all, even in the onboard SD card storage. If the camera hangs for a particular reason, you have to restart it. It is a pain to troubleshoot things when you are miles away from home in another city.Mi Home app requires almost all the permissions from your phone. But, I was able to disable most permissions except location and storage. Whats more! You get ads in the app right after opening it on the dashboard where you see the list of devices since version 5.4.43 released on Dec 26, 2018. I wish Xiaomi released a dedicated app for home security cameras, like other companies have done.Google Assistance isnt compatible with this camera, if you are into that sort of thing. Some other cameras from Xiaomi not released in India are supported, though.Once paired to the app and once you have the perfect setup with NAS and good wireless bandwidth to  from the camera, you may become addicted to use it under different conditions, such as with total darkness.If you are technically sound and have around 10k budget, Raspberry Pi based home security is a better option! If you are on a budget and if you dont want to spend a lot of time on technical things, then, Xiaomi Mi Home Security Camera is the best home monitoring camera you can get!,Good enough! It works as it shown,Nice camera and easy to install.

Extremely easy to use","I bought this item in August 2022, and the delivery and packaging was as good and sturdy as Ive come to expect from Amazon. Using the printer from my Macbook is a breeze over wifi, although printing over wifi from Android requires some poorly designed app from Canon and has no direct support.The only couple of issues I faced with this printer were during setup.1. Scanning the qr code for the setup guide didnt actually lead to much of a guide, rather a boilerplate page. I would only much later find out the way from that page to the actual guide. Canon could do a better job of surfacing the online guide, as the image clarity in the included hard copy is quite poor.2. Installation of cartridges seemed to take forever  I must have removed and reinserted them almost 5 times before they were properly detected. No error messages showed up, and I didnt know if I had recieved a faulty product, or if I was doing something wrong.3. Never having owned a printer, and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work, I ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray, leading to a jam at the first print itself. Thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces. Canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets  clearer access to the online guide mightve helped here.Except for the these minor concerns in setup, Im enjoying using this printer surprisingly, since printers alongside projectors  are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry. Ive used all the features so far  print  colored, double sided, scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality, wifi or the cartridges. Information on the number of color and blackandwhite sheets from the initial set of cartridges to be added when I run out,good scanner  printer,Installation procedure is very simple and priter quality is high. I had a Xerox copier, but istallation of scanner option could not complete.,If you are purchasing it for your home use, dont look any further. It has got all the functions youll find in a 2030k worth printers. All in one includes print, scan, copy and fax as well, Colour, adf, duplex printing, wifi. You download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself. Only two issue that I faced, firstly the print qualitywhich Ill speak to the service center and secondly is the total quantity of color prints. I have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is 90. I guess Ill have to purchase a larger cartridge.,Very good printer. Sometimes back to back printing cases paper blockage. But overall very happy,gud printer but printing cost is expensive. in this price range features are very nice.,I got this printer ion 02Nov2022, After 15days of usage ..Im unable to print as it is showing Color  black ink is low ..i have print less than 50pages ...and in description they told that 400pages yield which is totally wrong.,Cannon E4570.This was launched as a successor for E4270 I searched everywhere but couldnt find a credible source to explain the differences between the two. I researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me  wifi enabled so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop, clear color print decent for childs homework, photo quality not required and cheap to run. E4270 seem to fit all the criteria, so I ordered this. Even the canon authorised showroom didnt have E4570 in stock, so ordered the E4570 off Amazon.Summary  fullfills top two criteria. Though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional print.Delivery was 3 days earlier than the delivery date shown on Amazon, so that was great. It was just the printer box, with no outer packing. The box was sealed with cello tape, and not sealed, so I suspect it had been opened at some point. Thankfully, all the components were there, and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact, so i was ok with the delivery.Setup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi. I never had to use the usb cable. Setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website link for both given in manual, which guides step by step on how to setup. I did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devices.Color prints are a bit faded on plain paper 75gsm. This might be a function of the paper and not the printer. The blackwhite prints are crisp and sharp. The print speed is decent.The only negative is the amount of ink consumption. While the box says 180 color prints and 300 bw, both my cartridges are showing at 80 after 4 color print and around 30 bw. Specially for color prints, the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just 23 prints. I suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that 3040 full color pages. Refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option, but it is messy and requires practice. This is fine for me as I need color prints very rarely.A special mention for the ADF and duplex printing. Both the features are extremely useful. Duplex printing is especially unique in this price range, and comes in very handy while printing larger documents.Overall, I am happy with my purchase after couple of weeks of usage. I will update the review if I run into any issues.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31AZelC8URL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

If you didnt choose installation, then just SHOOT the video of unboxing by yourself, to avoid any hassle in case replacement is needed. Amazon Prime and Netflix are not inbuilt, but can be Sideloaded !!! To use your Set top box with android interface, you need to buy MI IR cable and set it up. OR else directly connect the set up box via AV or HDMI port, to use it conventionally. Out of 8GB memory, you only get around 4.7GB free to use check the image attachedThere are Hundreds of review on this TV here as well as on youtube, but NONE explains the TVs potential completely and what its actual flaws are. Heres a quick Fact for the Users complaining about the LESS cost to benefits ratio, guys if you buy a Android TV box alone which has processing capacity similar to this tv, then it would alone cost you more than 5K rupees  here you get this TV with that android setup with various other feature under 15K. So just check once, what options you have before complaining.Eventually I bought this TV, since I was already using 4A 43 version for months and wanted smaller version for bedroom. Now after using this TV for over 3 weeks, I am stating my DETAILED user experience. Its a detailed  huge review, but do read it, if you want to invest this much amount. If you want to get quick overview of the device, then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review  Firstly its budget friendly  ONLY Smart TV under 15k in the current market. Has Most number of Output port  1AV, 3HDMI, 2USB . Has Android 8.1 out of the box along with inbuilt Bluetooth Has Dual interface  MI Patchwall  Android TV  I mostly prefer android TV interface  Remote has Bluetooth  Voice Search with sleek profile. Has better processor compared to predecessor along with 1GB RAM  8GB storage  4.7GB actual  Speaker Output is low. Need IR cable for using set top box with android interface. Amazon prime  Netflix is NOT preloaded, but can be side loaded. Native Display is ONLY HD, though 1080p  even 4K videos from youtube works well check images attached. Can install  play tons of High quality games like RR3, etc check images attached. Finally smartphone mirroring works fine most of the time.FULL DETAILED REVIEW BUILT QUALITY  Has combination of plastic and aluminium for the main body. Its not great, but above average. Table top stands looks bit flimsy, but are workable. The screws which are provided in the box, DOES NOT fits the tv perfectly, so I bought new from local store. It has averagely slim profile, not the slimmest in the market. Speaker Placement is inconvenient. Since they are placed at the bottom, so when you keep it on table top, the sound tends to dampen and bulge. Has good ventilation for electronics and it hardly heats up. Overall built quality is above average.DISPLAY QUALITY  It has very Thin bezels, which looks great. Video resolution is 1366x768p, but 1080p videos works fine on it. 4K videos on youtube runs smoothly as well. Viewing angle are good compared to price.  Check the images attached  Contrast is above average, Brightness is good and colours are quite vivid. Display quality is also above average, not very great.REMOTE CONTROL  Its very sleek and compact. Has only 7 buttons and is easy to operate. Fortunately it has Volume buttons, which is handy.  I have couple of android TV boxes without volume button on remote, so I know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume P  Placement of Voice search button is improper. Its just below Power button, and I end up pressing power button a lot. Finally its bluetooth, so no need to point it towards tv for operation.OTHER FEATURES  It has Dual interface, i.e. Patchwall and android TV.  Has tons of content. Many games can be installed till you have memory left, including multiplayer games. Google voice search is very useful, if you dont want to use keyboard. Processing speed is fast and I havent detected any lags yet.  Lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed, not due to hardware  Bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectly.CONS  Speaker output though rated 20W, is NOT upto the mark. My 16W JBL speakers has better and louder sound. Placement of speaker is inconvenient, as in table top position, speakers face the table and sound dampens. Internal Memory is very LESS. NO Netflix and amazon prime pre loaded, though you can side load them. Miracast not supported. Even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes. Native resolution is just 720p HD, though the 1080p videos works on usb  4K on youtube. Screen is Slightly reflective, its similar to almost all the other LED tvs. Mixed experiences of after sales service.CUSTOMER CARE  Firstly the installation is a Joke. My installation was scheduled 16 days after my product Delivery and the fun part is, theres ONLY 10 days replacement window for this product P Company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their Representative, so theres NO point of return window time frame. MI has mixed reviews for repairs and services. Though I have not encountered any problem with any MI tv yet, I have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpful.VERDICT Considering all the facts, if you are fine with above average Display quality, want a Smart tv and if you have tight budget, then this the TV you should certainly go for. Trust me, you wont get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months. If you have higher budget, then certainly explore brands like sony, samsung, etc.This is NOT a perfect smart TV, but for the given price and 2 Years of warranty, its NO brainer to choose this, its certainly worth the investment.,This television is definitely a perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of 12500.Performance The processor in this Smart TV is powerful enough to play 4K 10bit HEVC videos right out of the box. VLC or MX player can be installed for enhanced media support.Picture Quality Many people complain about the overbright screen. But it can be compensated by adjusting the display settings.These are my preferred settings.Backlight 1 to 20During night even the lowest value of 1 is  bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyes.During day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions. A maximum of 20 would be enough.Setting backlight to minimum improves black levels, reduces power consumption, increases LED life and reduces eye strain especially during night.Brightness 48Brightness setting controls black level.Increasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrast.Brightness at 50, pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturationAt 45 black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies.48 is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of details.Contrast  40 to 45Contrast setting controls white level.Contrast can be set anywhere between 40 and 45. Increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in a picture, like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed. As the screen itself is very bright, increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright. Also colors gets washed out while increasing contrast.Saturation 45 to 50Color saturation can be set anywhere between 45 to 50. At 45 colors look more natural. At 50 colors looks a bit punchy. But still its a personal preference.At the above settings, the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of OLED TVs on YouTube at 1080p . The following Youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the TV.LG 4K OLED Beauty Of Black DemoLG OLED Eclipse 2 DemoLG HD Demo Art NouveauFull HD and 4K videos looks sharp in this TV. Downloaded a sample 4K HEVC video named Life Untouched and also a 4K HEVC sample of the movie Elysium. Both of them played smoothly on the TV with very good details.Screen Quality I think this is a VA panel , the quality of which sits right in between TN and IPS panels. The screen is glossy and hence reflective. This might be a problem if the TV is placed in a room with windows facing it.Like all other LCD panels, this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but thats only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds. While watching movies or other content its not at all a problem. Screen non uniformity is a common issue even with high end TVs of big brands like LG Samsung etc.Luckily theres no backlight bleeding in the unit  I received.Viewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but thats a common VA panel characteristic. IPS panels with good viewing angles cant be expected at this price point.All LCD panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses. IPS panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels. VA panels excels in black depth despite its average viewing angles and this TV has got very impressive black levels.Sound Quality Bass is a bit weak I think bass is improved following some updates. So giving 5 stars from 4. Its very loud even at low volume. Midrange and treble are very good. Even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearly.EditIn a previous review I have mentioned these EQ settings sounds good. But it isnt.100Hz  7300Hz  81000Hz  43500 Hz  610000 Hz  5A high value of 8 for 300 Hz actually make the sound muddy and muffled.The following settings sounds much better and heres the reason.100 Hz  8  BassFrequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like Kick Drum,Toms, Snare etc.300 Hz  4  Low MidrangeEnhances bass and depth of male vocals. Increasing 300Hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds1000 Hz  3  MidrangeImparts a metallic tone. Increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant.3500 Hz  5  Upper MidrangeVocals especially female sounds best at this frequency. A value of 5 enhances vocal quality. Increasing too much makes vocals harsh.10000 Hz  7 TrebleAdds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments. Enhances tinkling  sounds of metallic  instruments.Human ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies Here its 1000 and 3500 Hz. Setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue. Even increasing 300Hz is disturbing.Great sound performance especially bass is not even expected from a television in this budget. But considering its midrange frequency, clear treble and loudness, it deserves 4 stars.Remote Control Minimalism is great. But minimalism with less functionality is not so great. Addition ofMute,TV Settings and Video input selection buttons would ve made the remote more functional.App support UpdateWhen the TV was released there was no support for Netflix and Amazon Prime. But now with Pie update it supports both Netflix and Amazon Prime. Now the TV deserves 5 stars for app support.Pros and Cons Pros1. Powerful processor for 4K media playback.2. App installation via USB3. Built in Chromecast4. Bluetooth remote5. Voice CommandCons UpdatePreviously the main issues with the TV were the lack of Autoplay function and Standby option.But in the latest update both these issues are solved.Now when the TV is turned on it will automatically go to the previous Input sourceTo enable it, go to Settngs Inputs  Enable Stay on the previous source option.Screen off feature is also added in the new update. Long pressing Power button will show Screen Off option.The only disadvantage left on the TV was lack of Miracast. But on a latest update build PI.4316 miracast is included and now its perfect.To sum upOverall considering the picture quality, powerful hardware and the price, the TV definitely deserve 5 stars devoid of its average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other TVs in market with such features at this price point. Also Xiaomi now has got very strong service support across India.New brands like iFFalcon, Blaupunkt ,Thomson etc might provide better options at a competitive price.

The product did live up to my expectation!!Here are my observationsPros Excellent in performance. Accurate in motion detection. Can connect anytime from anywhere if the camera is connected to the internet. LED turns red when there is no internet connectivity. Crystal clear vision even in night.Cons Had to struggle a bit in configuring it. The usability of the app is not easy to understand. Figured out the right options to use after few trials. Hence giving 4 star rating. The LED doesnt glow green when it is recording though the option is turned on.Keep it up Hero Group and looking forward to more such great products from your organization!!,The Qubo 360 camera is great. I am able to set it up for my kittens whom I can be assured once I leave my house for some time. The best feature is the two way talk in which we can communicate via the camera itself.,Product is very easy to install as well as setup and use. It is excellent motion detection and also has person detection which is not available in this price range.,Camera quality and clarity are good. Also having excellent features. This camera was delivered on time and the tech support is also good. The only missing feature is that this camera lacks storage to external nvr.,I bought this model for my living room, its very decent and easy to install. Working very well.,It is I goo product I  using It and I hai be over 1 month and I have no issues with this product,Target has to fixed as it observed motion and went over there on wall it get stuck over there as no motion now next.,Great product. Works well, just faced couple of issues while setting up but after that it is working great.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31R3Qf2nO0L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Realme Smart TV Stick 4K,Type: HDMI|Power Requirement: DC 5 V|Number of Devices Supported: 1,"Great Product,Very good and working very nice,Horrible user experience on account of poor hardware,Not worthy. Laggy sometimes","Everything is great. I love this.,Very good and working very nice,First of all, thanks to Amazon for listing it as a returnable item and at an effective cost of less than 3k.Coming to the device itself, the reason for purchasing it is to experience Google TV. On that account, the interface is more useful than the standard Android TV one in terms of discovery, but the listed content is not that relevant.However, it is Realme that lets the user down. The device was bug ridden from the beginning and they basically abandoned the device in 6 months, with the last software update in Feb 2022, still riddled with bugs and never to see Google TV 12.The stick heats up enough to scald you if you touch it and it stutters like crazy after usage of over a day, in part due to the lackluster A35 ARM cores which is lacking in performance compared to A53 cores present in sticks from over 7 years ago, and also due to poor RAM management.Only reason to get it would be for the price, if it is less than 3k, but be prepared to suffer through a laggy interface and the known issues of the remote failing within a few months. Still males more sense to get a Fire TV stick which is more refined and receives more updates, although the interface is a love or hate it one.For the Google TV experience, it is better to go with Google TV with Chrome cast but that costs a bomb in India, for what it offers.,Got  used  product.It was trapped and also proformance is twice degrade to fire stick also not sucking wifi well as computer to Fire Stick",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31M+JM+KZIL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

The quality is good just for the looks however the fins are very thin and unable to produce the same heat with same power as Bajaj.Although I am comparing it with Bajaj 13 fins still the room size was 12x10ft and borosil heater really struggled to even put the room to a comfortable temperature. With Bajaj it was done within half hour however borosil took even 2 hrs and still we were feeling uncomfortable.The fan placement is low and it doesnt converts that much heat for faster heater even with max settings.Please check both physically if possible, Bajaj is on a heavier side and fins are of good quality.Though I received 2 defective Bajaj heater  physical dent on body from cloudtail , I have again ordered the same. Hope this time it turns out to be good.No company is providing the details of the oil quality used in their product. Good luck.,I have used bajaj oil filled heater before. This feels more sturdy. I think havells and borosil make the best quality oil filled heater in terms of sturdiness and finish. Although its a simple assembly but still I wanted to buy a good brand as it draws a lot of power and I was concerned about safety.It makes the room warm quickly. Based on the power mode you choose. It will make the room dry. I have seen people using  water vaporiser alongside but on low power I havent felt too try in 12 hours of use.Overall, since it was borosil, I expected an even more beautiful look but since it works well I am happy. Easily 1.52 k costlier than its peers.,Using 3rd Party offbrand blowers for years, I finally took the leap and bought the 13 fin Volcano from Borosil. It has transformed the way with its reliability and efficiency.PackagingThe item was secured and packed very well with amazon packaging along with the original Borosil Packaging.AssemblyUsing the provided guidebook was easy to understand. The unit comes as assembled but you have to attach the castor wheels which was pretty easy. Then all was left was to plug it in.UsageThe heater warmed up the 20ftx20ft room with relative ease. It has 3 power levels for the fan attached and a temperature regulator. The heater takes 56 minutes to heat up and bring the room up to temperature.LooksThe product looks very well and the black fin structure helps meld well with any decor you have in your room.Additionally, the twoyear warranty and the safety features make it a mustbuy product for winters.910 would buy again,Did not give the expected result,Ordered this OFR a month ago and have had used it since then. It is a powerful product to warm up the room pretty quickly. Although the first few minutes are slow but then it picks up the pace and evenly heats up the entire room. It is quite and doesnt even vibrate. I already own an OTG and an egg boiler and now the OFR. Borosil has stood up to the mark providing good quality appliances at a decent price tag.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qqrzjPySL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Connect keyboard, mouse and other devices to facilitate working.|Portronics Mport 31 comes with a 1-year manufacturer’s warranty.","Nice product,It works!,Indoor device, not for field use!,Does the job,Value for money product.,Good product,Till now...Using since 7 days..Its good,Useful USB multiplier","Easy to install.Working great, recommended for light use.If you want to use hard disks without lagging then i will suggest to buy self powered usb hub,The product does what it is intended to do....however, it does not compliment the sleek laptop I use it with.  Probably a direct plug in extension no cord would be a much better option.,Needed a portable USB extension. Headphones, keyboard and mouse. Serves the purpose for an indoor setting. Have explained why it is not an outdoor device under the cons.Pros Nice design, Sleek, unobtrusive suits some work environments. For those who have limited table estate, go for models that have vertical USB slots, saves space. This is for those who can have it flat next to the laptopcomputer. check image Works well for Audio, HIDs, and great for Data Transfer.Observation An interesting observation when using usb keyboard, the USB drive is as if not more sensitive than direct typing. With mechanical USB keyboards there is a latency but chiclet and USB Dongle based wireless keyboards seem to work well. USB or wireless USB RF mouse works perfectly. Very little noticeable latency Not for gaming purposes keyboardsmicejoysticks etc.. This is a no brainer. In rapid response gaming environments were latency is life or death. An extension is not an option.Cons Check ImageThe USB female slots in the extension are shallow. The male plugs do not go in fully. There is 0.5 cm of the metal plug exposed. This may be a risk in exposedoutdoor environments. Humidity increases the chances of electric shock, and dust being an insulator may cause static electricity build up. The worst case is if a conductor falls across the exposed points, the whole system can short out.Suggest the designers take this into consideration for their next batch of products. The depth of the USB slots needs to accommodate the full length of the USB plugs.Functionally it works, design leaves a lot wanting. Go for it if are sure you can be safe, go for a different model if you need this for outdoor use.Update 15th Nov 2022On connecting the keyboard to the usb drive, there seems to be an increased latency and sometimes the keyboard does not respond as anticipated. The text does not appear on the screen immediately and sometimes a particular letter just cascades repeatedly, and one has to press backspace often to delete the excess letters. For data transfer it works fine but has lower speeds, when all four slots are being used. Expected probably!,Works well and does the job.,I like it very much.Value for money...,Product is excellent. Just that wire is very short ! Rest all good,Using in laptop,Useful USB multiplier and works well for headsets too  was apprehensive earlier if it deteriorates the audio qualityOnly drawback is the length of cable as it keeps protruding out of Laptop bag",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/21UKIwf0IVL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

So ive used it almost 6 months and giving honest review.In short if you are getting it during sale time 899999,then its a steal deal..also in regular price bw 12991499 its a good product..Sound quality is good. Enough loud at 5060 volume. Bass is also ok. Whenever needed it produces punchy bass. Overall balanced.Mic quality is good in indoor condition,but in noisy environment you cant rely on this. Recevier cant clearly listen to you.You can do gaming as company claiming low latency,i myself didnt test it.Now about battery backup,company claim it will give battery backup of 42 hours with case. 6 hours in single chargeAdditional 36 hours6 times charge via case. But in practical use it gives total 35 hours playback. It will give around 5 hours backup on single charge of buds  5060 volumeif you only listen to music or watching video,but no call or gaming You can charge the earbuds full 6 times via case so additional 30 hours.Just one issue with its design,suit case type box  not easy to carry in pocket. I would say its a personal preference. If you are into good looks,design then its not for you.Now its regular pricing varries between Rs 12991499. In this price range also it is one of the best tws under 1500. I will tell why.. now a days many brands are launching tws in the market under 1500. Most of them sound almost similar, difference is like 1920!! They are just marketing their tws with huge hours of battery backup  by youtubers,reviewers. 4850 hours of playtime is just myth. Ive personally used TrukeAirbuds lite,Buds F1 which is by far the most false promising brand claiming 48 hours of battery in their every tws,but only give 21 hours. Even other tws of boatAirdopes 121 pro which claim 4045 hours playback only give around 25 hours,Defy Gravity Z claiming 50 hours only give 28 hours. If you are impressed by their looks  huge battery backup and thinking to buy those,you will be disappointed after purchase. Instead go with this,you will not be disappointed.,I read the negative comments first and decided not to buy it because the comments said it gives high latency on gaming like PUBG and also it falls from ear while running. And that the difference between normal and beast mode slightly had differenceBut a PUBG youtuber Recommended me this so I decided to give it a try, after trying out myself.Let me provide the facts for youI have a boat rockerz 510 headphone which obviously should be better than this airdope but this airdope surprised me by doing 2x better in providing accurate sound in PUBG.Its been 23 days I used it daily for 67 hours on full charge, it has no buttons and it works on touch sensor which was impressive for me and in PUBG it doesnt give delay as written in the comments, it has a good latency better than what I had expected from the negative comments.Sometimes though I faced the issue where one side of the airdope stops working because its either on standby without detecting the user or a bug which is included in the faqguidehelp card in the box Im satisfied in terms of gaming.For sports like running I wouldnt recommend because it slips away however maybe u can tie the airdope with a thread attached to ur neck so that its safe from landing on the ground Im gonna try that, please dont use both the airdopes while running on the roads with vehicles running for your own safety keep one side of your ear free for hearing sounds from your environment.,Pros1. The level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if youre at the gym, these are perfect.2. Awesome Bass!3. Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u wont be able to hear things around u very well, its great for places like Gym.4. Lovely battery life, Ive had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and youll be getting battery for a long long while.5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.6. Affordable!7. The touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. Can also pick up calls just by tapping.8. Multiple ear coverings are provided with it.9. Type C portCons1. The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. The bass is the highlight so its great for music, but for movies or gaming, you wont get the most crisp audio.2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence Edit after 1 month use its now a very frequent issue3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. Not an issue if you are the one dialing i hope its just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there lol so Im very very happy with themHighly recommended for music andor as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31GUbeFG3FL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Whichever bud you will pull from the box that only will work.But if you use only 1 bud then any one of it will work  because any one of them can be used as master.You can use only one any one of them at a time and you can use its mic for call, touch controls to receive or cut calls. Or else playpause music.But this dynamic use of mic have some bug. Sometimes this change wont happens properly and mic will not work or the other bud which is inside box may have active mic started so the person you are talking to will complain about voice is not coming. Or some time may be muffled audio.Put both buds inside box and then take out again to reset it and it will work again properly.1 time I faced error that even after putting both buds inside didnt make them off and they continued connected to mobile.I connected box to charger and the issue resolved.You can put 1 bud inside ear and other hold in hand and keep close to mouth to get superior mic quality even in streets where a lot of noise is or in the office where you need to speak in very low voice.Battery backup is almost same as claimed. You can watch movies, call for ling period and listen to song whole day without the need to charge the box.If you put buds inside box inbetween for few minutes then you can really use it for a day or 2 easily.,Overall the pods are good .I dont know this piece is damaged or my system is lagging, sound delay happens at any random.But this sounds good , good product.Worth it ,Product giod for music or vedio but bad for calling,not good as expected,, after few days,left side earbud not working..,looking good but not working good....,I have had Boults wired earphones before and I loved them. But this is just way off the mark. The case is flimsy. It may look sturdy but it is light as a feather.The earphones themselves dont connect unless you take them out of the case. And even when they do, there is pretty loud voice announcing it. For someone like me who doesnt put the volume up too high, that voice is really irritating.Also I have noticed that the audio cuts out sometimes. I have no idea whether thats a connectivity issue or something else.In conclusion, just go for something else. This was a bad one by Boult.,Nice product ,I am not sure what to say!

The earbuds are comfortable to wear and have a good fit, and the sound quality is impressive for the price point.However, I was disappointed to discover that the earbuds do not have noise cancellation as advertised. While they do block out some ambient noise, they are not as effective as other earbuds Ive used with noise cancellation technology.The battery life has been satisfactory. The earbuds last for a good amount of time on a single charge, and the case is convenient for charging on the go.Overall, I would recommend the boAt Airdopes 181 earbuds for those looking for a budgetfriendly option with good sound quality. Just be aware that they do not have noise cancellation.,I am writing this review after two days of usage.1. Sound Quality The lows are good and pleasing to the ears. Bass quality is good.

It made me start building trust on the brand.I use S21 ultra which can be charged at 25W and this cable supports the same with the Samsungs original charger. I strongly believe the product would work at the rated power delivery 60W.It looks and feels sturdy and I am expecting it to be durable too.The 90 ends keep the cables away without out interfering with the work space. Works the best when playing battle royale games as the cable wont come in the way.The grey and black colour combination works as a charm and would blend in with Apple devices.Data transfer speeds are yet to be tested. I will update here once I have enough inputs on the same.After using multiple cables from Ambrane, Wayona, Wecool, and more brands Portronics definitely stands as a good contender for all of them that serve the same purpose.Verdict I would definitely recommend this Typec to Typec cable if you need to charge devices at 60W or less.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41ngtt1EmoL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

I dont watch movie or YT on mobile network and I wonder how many does watch FHD, 2K, 4K videos over mobile network. For downloading documents, social networks, banking apps 4G is more than enough.In my budget I found all phones have 4gb RAM. Realme Narzo 50 was 9999 during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note 11. But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note 11 with 6gb RAM at 11749 . 6gb RAM is always preferred over 4gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not, also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away. So this was the only option I knew then available.Redmi note 11 has AMOLED Display, I am not bothered with 60Hz, 90Hz,120Hz. I keep the refresh rate at 60Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. All my Desktop screen has 60Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a 90 Hz screen I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me. Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you dont need that. Display size is 6.43 inch it could have been better if it were 6.7 inch. I prefer big display phone. Redmi note 12 has that big display. A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that. The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. The screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.This phone duel speakers. One is more powerful at bottom and another on top. But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT. Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. What more do you expect from such tiny speakers!The phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor, still I get good signal, and never disconnected. Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.The phone has 5000mAh battery and comes with 33W charger which is a bonus at this price point. The battery gives long backup. With good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, FB, WA etc. But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70.The phone has SD680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. The experience is butter smooth. However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I dont have to clear RAM manually. However after Android 12 update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared. SD 680 doesnt heat up and it is very energy efficient. Because of that battery drains very little and 33W charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. The cable is USB A to C and feels good.This phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.This phone has DDR4X RAM and UFS 2.2 storage. The RAM is 6GB and can be expanded additional 1 GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage. But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life. This has 2 Sim  SD card slot. Which is a great. Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregation.The phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. And I have no problem with plastic. I dont think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. I am happy with plastic back. The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. This is inherent chemistry of TPU, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.The fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. The touch screen is excellent too.However I dont like some of the preinstalled apps. Some can be uninstalled a few cant especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store. I dont like them. However I like the pre installed security app. There is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. Does not show pictures like 8MP camera. I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note 11 back camera. MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI. MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.So I give Redmi 11 a score of 9.510. This is an excellent phone the I got at 11749 during Great Indian festival. I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. This phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2K, k videos or shoot such things. This is not or those who are crazy for 5G. Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. Good battery LIFE. Bqest for dayday use. 33W charger also good.2.

But ui13 all way better than bloody MIUI 12.5.7. 4G chipset SD 680, which is fine... 4G always available.8. Some minor issue with WiFi reception. Dont know may be they will fix it through OTA. THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE  THERE, CASUAL GAMER  BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWSMOVIES...

The third impressive factor is its dual speaker....I have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it. Media playback experience is also enhanced by its amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point. Fingerprint button is also very responsive. All other things and features are good to the price point.Only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old Redmi Y2 which I exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....So plz I request you to all .... dont buy this for camera....just dont. The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......I dont recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.If you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.Pros design, inhand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakerCons camera,Quite a smooth daily driver phone. The overall experience has been satisfactory, cameras good, durability also seems to be good, Ive dropped it quite a few times  the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up. 120hz feels great. Charging speed is good too, nothing mindblowing though. Battery life is decent. Lasts quite a bit, but since I keep it in the 120hz mode all the time, its a little less for me. But I dont have any problem with battery life for now.,It does what the description says.Camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. Even A3 model clicks better pics.Finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.Volume is good for both call and streaming.Fast charging but charger gets heated soon.Battery back up is good, unless you dont do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.Dual app and dual space option is missing.Light weight and good video resolution.Overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography  gaming.,I bought this for my dad and its working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,Phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. After that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.When i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/411yU+n3UkL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. What more do you expect from such tiny speakers!The phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor, still I get good signal, and never disconnected. Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.The phone has 5000mAh battery and comes with 33W charger which is a bonus at this price point. The battery gives long backup. With good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, FB, WA etc. But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70.The phone has SD680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. The experience is butter smooth. However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I dont have to clear RAM manually. However after Android 12 update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared. SD 680 doesnt heat up and it is very energy efficient. Because of that battery drains very little and 33W charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. The cable is USB A to C and feels good.This phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.This phone has DDR4X RAM and UFS 2.2 storage. The RAM is 6GB and can be expanded additional 1 GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage. But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life. This has 2 Sim  SD card slot. Which is a great. Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregation.The phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. And I have no problem with plastic. I dont think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. I am happy with plastic back. The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. This is inherent chemistry of TPU, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.The fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. The touch screen is excellent too.However I dont like some of the preinstalled apps. Some can be uninstalled a few cant especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store. I dont like them. However I like the pre installed security app. There is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. Does not show pictures like 8MP camera. I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note 11 back camera. MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI. MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.So I give Redmi 11 a score of 9.510. This is an excellent phone the I got at 11749 during Great Indian festival. I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. This phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2K, k videos or shoot such things. This is not or those who are crazy for 5G. Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. Good battery LIFE. Bqest for dayday use. 33W charger also good.2. Best display but shouldve 120hz instead of 90.3. Sturdy inhand feel4. Stereo speaker is loud and crisp6535 split.5. Camera above average... But good concerning the price.6. Buggy UIminor as expected. But ui13 all way better than bloody MIUI 12.5.7. 4G chipset SD 680, which is fine... 4G always available.8. Some minor issue with WiFi reception. Dont know may be they will fix it through OTA. THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE  THERE, CASUAL GAMER  BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWSMOVIES... NOT INTENDED FOR HEAVY GAMINGNOT FOR PUBG, COD LOVERS.,The first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and its all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, its battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33W, is also a good deal at this price. The third impressive factor is its dual speaker....I have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it. Media playback experience is also enhanced by its amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point. Fingerprint button is also very responsive. All other things and features are good to the price point.Only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old Redmi Y2 which I exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....So plz I request you to all .... dont buy this for camera....just dont. The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......I dont recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.If you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.Pros design, inhand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakerCons camera,Quite a smooth daily driver phone. The overall experience has been satisfactory, cameras good, durability also seems to be good, Ive dropped it quite a few times  the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up. 120hz feels great. Charging speed is good too, nothing mindblowing though. Battery life is decent. Lasts quite a bit, but since I keep it in the 120hz mode all the time, its a little less for me. But I dont have any problem with battery life for now.,It does what the description says.Camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. Even A3 model clicks better pics.Finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.Volume is good for both call and streaming.Fast charging but charger gets heated soon.Battery back up is good, unless you dont do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.Dual app and dual space option is missing.Light weight and good video resolution.Overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography  gaming.,I bought this for my dad and its working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,Phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. After that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.When i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4121yWSVFmL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

Color is typical samsung style with oversaturated greens. Interesting to note that JN1 is also being used in Samsungs new F23.Thermal management is very poor. Device heats up in normal usage within minutes if the screen brightness is high. Same is the case when camera app is openedsimple games on flipkart gamezone are played. There are reports on youtube of narzo50s camera shutting down on hot days.Above scenarios and 120Hz adaptive refresh rate also drain battery like crazy.Speaker and earpiece do not have crispiness upper treble, instead sound like white noise. Earpiece volume is low. So is the speaker volume when on call. On the other hand, speaker volume is decent while playing back videos.Flashlight is half as bright as normal smartphones. I dont really know if company did cost cutting here, or its a software bug.No fm radio and secondary mic.Minor features I missed if shifting from miui to realmeui  e.g. the gallery app is not as good as miui one, requiring more taps for basic opeeations like viewing whatsapp images folder.Mediocre ram management with realmeui 2, android 11.To be fair, I could not find any major bug in realmeui 2.0 so far. The lcd display is fantastic, and very well calibrated with relatively cooler white point, as opposed to yellowish 55006500k super amoled. There was no green or purple tint. Touch response was excellent. Screen protector, case, fast charger, usb c cable were present. The phone feels much slimmer than my bulky F22 due to its thin body, 10gm less weight and sleek case. Camera app has full fledged manual mode, something absent from Samsungs F22.Disclaimer Above impression has been made after using 4 smartphones over last 8 years Asus Zenfone 5, Redmi 4, Redmi 7A, Samsung F22.Strongly consider other current alternatives too, like Redmi note 11, Poco m4 pro, Poco m4 pro 5g, Redmi note 10t 5g,  Samsung F22, Samsung F23, Moto G42 before buying Narzo 50.More info Do not fall for bloatwares like glance when setting up the phone. Check as few check boxes as possible before blindly clicking I agree. Turn off content recommendation by going to the Settings  Additional Settings  Get Recommendations and switch the green toggle off. To remove bloatwares that cannot be uninstalled usual way, follow excellent guide by youtuber tech office mentioning all realme app names required for adb commands. I was able to uninstall hot appsgames this way.UPDATEDetailed camera comparison between Samsung F22 and Narzo 50Samsungs HDR algo seems more sophisticated, narzo unnaturally brightens some shadows too much, there is also some oversharpening.Both cameras choose cool auto white balance, which results in bluer skies but lifeless greeneries even in golden hours. However, narzos colors become more hue accurate after choosing 60006500k white point in expert mode, whereas samsung still delivers bluish green foliage colors at cloudy white balance. Narzo strangely does some weak auto hdr even in expert mode, but samsung fully turns it off in pro mode, resulting unusable photos.However, when using night mode, narzos photos appear more cleaner but less saturated at night.  Gcam 8.5 for narzo is not optimized properly and gives noisy night photos with greenish cast and crushed shadows, much worse than realmes night mode. On the other hand, thereas no gcam and no camera2api support for F22. At night, you can take long exposure shots upto 81632secs through expert mode by manually choosing shutter speed in narzo, something you cant do in F22. This however requires tripod support and whenever done properly, the results are very good.You have manual film mode in narzo, whereas you cant even manually set white balance in F22s video mode, as samsungs lower end galaxys dont have pro video mode.,This mobile is suitable for every oneIts goodBut camara is average, quality,Very good phone .Iam very happy with this while using.thank you Amaon.,I had purchased this phone in 10k and this phone is actually brilliant in this price range, Camera is good, fingerprint sensor is good, back panel is good i purchased black one , no hang but there is a small problem that battery drains little faster and when you click Home button, google assistant appears most of the time which is quite annoying sometimes, overall i am happy with the phone .,I wanted an affordable phone  this fits the bill perfectly.,Fantastic finger reader, battery sustainability for a long time usage, and HD Quality natural photographs.

For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if youre conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging Im using a OnePlus 65W charger as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent, I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days. Ive been using Boat Cables for about 6 years now a cable from a Moto G4 phone is still with me and in use  and will stick to them.,Got the original one, but there are fake cables being sold, so beware.It warp charges as it supports 6A power supply.

Pro Design for perfect ergonomics and a beautiful glass back design,"Solid phone, worth considering,Good Phone,Overall decent product,Apart from the camera everything is fine,Product is good,Honest Review after 14 days usage,Superb but need improvement in camera,Best camera","I bought this phone after tonnes of research and watching and reading several YouTube videos and blog reviews of multiple phones. My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I dont regret. Ive used redmi phones before so Im aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone one of the worst phones Ive ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that. Heres my review of this phone based on 2 months of usagePros1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise its sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range its not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 4045 mins from below 10 battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares.

Quick Response After the TV is delivered call the customer care for the installation and within 2 hour technician arrive and installed the TV. After that received call back from the customer care to gather the experience and pinged on whatsapp so that if in future encountered any issue quick help will be provided.2. Quality Quality of TV is good and can watch all the contents from the apps in max resolution supported by TV i.e., 1080p.3. Steal deal, during the GIF sale received the TV in 13299 which is just wow price.4. Sound Quality is good.5. Android 11 is good and the extra feature which I find beneficial when compared to my old android 9 tv is the voice search feature which now search the content from another apps also after giving permission which is not working on android 9 tv.6. Bluetooth remote with some extra feature. Bought the TV as already have the TCL s6500 32 inch model back in 2018 when it is launched and tv is working flawlessly and since did not encountered any issue so bought this brand tv again when required second TV.Improvement 1. Bluetooth remote should have the all apps button on remote instead of TCL menu which my previous android s6500 tv have, due to which have to move with some extra click which is annoying for my parents to use.2. in Bluetooth remote they provide some extra button to move directly to youtube, netflix, tcl channel, prime, guard and media, instead of this some customization be provided so that we can configure the buttons to some others apps as per our personal use. out of these button guard, media and tcl channel are most useless button.3. android tv should come with atleast 1.5gb as with 1 GB variant the tv is little slow and already have many preinstalled tcl apps which we cannot remove so tv experience in little bit slow, however buy the model by knowing this limitation as already using 1.5 GB ram old variant of the same brand.other feature are also these which are cons but those are already mentioned in description and user should be aware of them before buying like one such point is 3.1 star is removed because of point 1 and point 3 as it is not making fluid experience of using android tv when watch all the contents from the apps.,Good for value almost all apps r able to download,Less weight and pretty valuable to the budget... And even customer support also available all time.,Like,Good one for this price. .

I have bought a couple of Honor fitness bands earlier for family, but this is my personal first. I have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last 10 months or so and Im aware of most of the products in the budget range. While I can afford a slightly more expensive one GTS2GTR2 or Honor GT2 Pro, Oppo Watch, Fitbit etc with calling feature, I wanted to get the feel of a smartwatch in the budget range first. I gave a lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included GPS and Amazon Alexa yet to be included, but must be available through an OTA update. Id have loved to buy Amazfit Bip U Pro as it has almost the same features with an LCD display has GPS and Alexa in the global version named Amazfit Pop Pro. It still isnt released in India.Coming to the watchs performance, the typical features I tried today first day are Heart RATE HR, SPO2, Stress monitoring and GPS. I have a pulse oximeter from Dr. Trust at home and so I could compare the HR and SPO2. The numbers on the watch arent very accurate to my surprise heart rate variation by 510 bpm and SPO2 percentage off by 10 points at times . But I still feel its more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc. GPS was a breeze as I walked on the terrace of my rural town house. It wont surprise me if I dont get the same performance in a metro city with a lot of high rise apartments etc. The compass worked fine when I compared it with my phone. Music controls worked fine, bluetooth data transfer or sync was good. I couldnt control the phone camera as I couldnt get that feature to work refer to image and help me if you can. I didnt face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications. The readability on the watch screen has been really good. Tried a couple of workouts. While the step count seems to be fine, not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modes.To conclude, I wouldnt say that this watch is a disappointment, but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats. Probably I should give it more time, but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy at least the Honor bands Ive seen. Eagerly waiting for Alexa update as Im curious what all it can do.I would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days. Lets see.Update 8th Jan 2021 The battery is a clear disappointment as many other users pointed out. Im hardly getting it for 3.5 days with always on display and an occasional workout. Limited watch faces, both on device 4 and the app 57. Not many out of these 57 do justice to the good display. Waterproof nature of the device is good. I didnt dip it in water, but it got wet when I was bathing my kids and it seems to have a waterproof coating which was in action. I got the camera shutter to work. I hope Amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable Alexa. Notifications didnt have an issue, but could not clear individual items clear all worked,REVIEW OF AMAZFIT GTS 2 Mini Smart watch 2021 modelHello everyone . Since the new model of amazfit GTS2 mini arrived , i am going to review the old model of itProsDisplay  1.55 inch amoled display , really good look .  prosBattery  coming with 220 maH , from 100 percent to 13 percent it takes 10 days to drain and it was expected to last 1 day longer  normal use  . But If you are a light user ,it can last it for 14 days . ProIP rating IP 68 water resistant which is cool .ProHeartbeat sensor  It has heartbeat sensor and it is real , but it may not show real accuracy at all the time . But it performs good proComfortness  It is really comfortable wearing this watch and the band is silicone material. proWork out modes  There are nearly 70 workout modes and i tested out some , since it is built in GPS , it works nearly accurate but the measure is not that much accurate but it works well. procan track stressHas PAI feature to progress your workout with better experienceAlexa assistant  but need phone connection to activate this Has other modes like breathing ,menstrual cycle tracking,todolist , inbuilt alarm ,pomodoro timer ,sleep tracker ,Timer , In built compass , camera remote ,find the phone , controlling music etc.Notification system  you can get notifications .Call control system  You can accept or reject calls , but you cannot able to talk through watch.ConsBuild quality it is told that this watch is completly aluminium frame but it is quite disappointing that only half frame is gun metal aluminium . and half is poly carbonate con .Watch faces  the inbuilt watch faces are quite depressing at initial impressions but there are some watch faces that are really good . conSPO2  I dont know how much accurate it is , but coming to technical part , the sensors are failing most of the times . Sometimes cannot able to sync workout history .conVerdict It is not a bad idea to spend money for this watch due to immense features and real sensors but you should compromise on sensors efficiency and build quality .,The incoming call notification disconnects if youre away from the watch even though other notifications are displayed in the watch. I have accidentally hit the display of the watch while walking in walls and steel doors, even though its not Damaged. Water resistance is good. I used to wash dishes wearing it. No use of Alexa.i think its a good buy after 2 months of usage,all over Amazfit GTS2 Mini New Version is good but price is high and also calling features not available that is the biggest drawback. apart for this other things are really nice.,Sleep tracking is fantastic but there is some bug after the update is that the sleep traking track itself even we not wear the watch.Rather all thing are fantastic and battery life is 7 day in normal uses",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41eEK+FeFyL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

I am an oldfashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes  but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement  which is entirely nonnegotiable  is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games which do not need much memory or processing capacity. I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage. Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending emails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf  primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one M30, the new phone M33 offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage.  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an immersive listening experience and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers  because old chargers, like old handsets, add to ewaste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 6070 charge at the end of the day, and it takes 3040 minutes for complete charging one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging. It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10watt charger, except that it would have taken 6090 minutes for full charging.I conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone  but for my requirements.

I am an oldfashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes  but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement  which is entirely nonnegotiable  is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games which do not need much memory or processing capacity. I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage. Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending emails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf  primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage which my son had recommended.

For any other information, please contact Amazon customer support | Wall Mount is not included in the box and will be charged extra at the time of installation|Easy returns: This product is eligible for replacement within 10 days of delivery in case of any product defects, damage or features not matching the description provided","Decent product. Value for money.,Value for money,Improvements Needed,Everything thing good except the installation experience,Overall taking all aspects TV is good within the price point,Tv installation services,One among the good TVs in the market.,Picture","I am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.Usage Continuous, OTT only, no CableDish operator.Average daily usage 68 hours.The TV is a great valueformoney product.Installation The installation was simple and Amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hasslefree.Picture The picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a Sony, LG and Samsung with these kind of specs. Movies and especially hires TV series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hires , wouldnt look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of Sony, Samsung LG etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone elses better TV.Sound Sound output is decent. You wouldnt need additional support to enhance the volume as such.Remote Sleek, sensitive and userfriendly. Its exactly like Amazons remote.OS Same as any smart Android TV. Works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. Switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than Sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.Standalone and as your first smart TV,  you wouldnt find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hires from the beginning. It is a great value for money product without a doubt.However, if you are considering this as an alternative or second TV after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,Picture quality is good for this price, didnt faced any lag on UI and browsing other apps. Only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. Overall worth for money u spend. But the installation process is just awful, Amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. No demo given on Tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,Screen looks amazing but problem is with processor I believe. If 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickersnot so often but problem exists, even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.Reason why I believe processor is bad because I do 4k gaming using PS5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,If you buy TV in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. When you want to buy a TV from Amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. The problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. Its like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you cant eat. So I ordered my TV on Monday, it got delivered on Friday and it will be installed on Monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. If we had the technician details, we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.Regarding product, its good quality and very good for a average user. Heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, I guess.,This TV gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1 The installation guy didnt arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didnt came for installation purpose. So strictly be aware of this point.2 The TV I got in offer with 3k discount on ICICI card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3 Even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece I didnt got the replacement for the product and its totally unfair deal by Amazon and the seller too.Final verdict is the TV quality and feature are good but the service from seller and Amazon that is got was very poor inspite I was prime member. The seller DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases Amazon will not help you. Thankyou,Team,Also to be added TV installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. NO need to other subvendor to getting installation and demo. Also dependency on thirdparty involvement should be less.Bad experience with TV installation stuff.Pls look into this .,Picture quality good. Sound quality  not upto my 3xpectations. Not able to find the real Dolby stereo effect. Remote not upto the mark.4  for picture quality, 3 for both sound and remote quality,Good quality picture but it hangs on home screen",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/51ovMTXv9RL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

The installation process is easy, and the product is very reliable. The 4level safety feature ensures that the water heater is safe to use and prevents accidental scalding. The water heater heats the water quickly, and the temperature can be adjusted to suit my needs. The only problem I am facing is with the indicator. Ideally, the red light shows that the water is getting heated, and it turns off when the water is heated enough. But in my unit, its vice versa. The green indicator is working as red, and the red indicator is green.,it is worth buying . it works well,First of all packaging was poor.Secondly Crompton says it is good for family of 3 members bath bucket but for that waiting is too long.Go for higher rated geyser from Crompton.,Installation is not hard. Instruction book is given. Only lacking point is warranty card is sign n seal. Warranty card is valueless,Works just fine, but I must say it is useful more for kitchen purpose, and in bathroom if u dont use shower, cuz after running for a couple of seconds the temp. Of the water drops, heating is not that effective being instant. If anyone wants to take hot shower must go of geysers with larger storage capacity.,The packaging was good and intact. No connecting pipes were inside. The power cable was very short. That made things bit difficult. I bought a 3m lengthy connecting hose for cold and hot water supply. I installed it myself and registered online on Crompton site. If you have drill machine or if you can borrow it, it just takes two holes to complete the installation.

Amazon needs to train their delivery staff on unpacking different types of things since they have come up with a policy where they need to open the package and verify any defects. 2 stars to them as they are not careful with the unpacking. I could see that they were holding the TV panel while getting the TV out from the box and even after telling them to be careful they werent. Also the stand was just thrown on the front panel cause he has nit understanding where it was at when they opened the box which could have damaged the Screen.Howerver very satisfied with the Sony Installation. The engineer has good hands on and very experienced with the installation.,TV picture quality is good. WiFi connection is little slow but it works mostly fine if router is nearby. Delivery was good and fast. The Sony installation service is very poor near Bengaluru. Guy came late, next day to scheduled day that too after calling many times. He came and went like a bullet doesnt tell most of the things about TV like need to update system and all.But overall TV works fine. We have 65 inch Bravia.,Song TV contacted after this review and resolved all below issue Thank u sony TVPicture  and sound quality is very good  its to good but in software so many bugs  wifi auto connectivity issue need to connect your same  wifi again and again , sound setting after conecting sound bar need If we selected Speaker audio system then need to use 2 remotes to do sound adjustment , in My Mi TV I am using only TV remote to adjust sound and aame connectivity  same soundbar,  Unable to connect soundbar via bluetooth IN Mi TV same sound bar connected easlyRemote size is so big so many falatu keys in remote like 1 ro 9 no keys fast forward keys etc and in down side blank space. And aftrr software update I seen little picture quality low as compare before software update.,The tv is great at this purchase price. Sony tvs are generally very adaptive. Colour and picture qualty is really good. Sound is nice as well. Would however advise to use external speakers with a tv of such size.,If you dont wish to purchase a sound bar, go for this model. The picture quality is beautiful, works with apple play, its a win win. I got the 43 for my bedroom on a great offer. And yeah, its a Sony. A wonderful purchase, absolutely worth it.,Best TV in its segment! Outstanding built quality. Sony TV may seem little bulky compared to some other fancy TVs but I have seen over the years that they never compromise on quality.I was little skeptical about picture clarity since it is big 65 TV but found it better than expected. Sound quality is also very good for a LED TV. Non HD channels are little less clear not bad though still it is good but its obvious seeing screen size.,Has complained on TV getting struck. Their dealer called while i was driving. Requested to call visit for TV reset later.Their service manager came into conference call, listened over.  He advised dealer to treat the service call as closed without issue being resolved and dealer service centre till date not resolved issue.  Our TV is still getting hung sometimes and we are managing by restarting tv every time,I have recently bought the 43inch model. The picture  sound quality is good. It does not come with an antiglare coating. Do not install the TV in front of the window.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uVckL1jRL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

In-Display Fingerprint Sensor|Special Features: Hyperboost gaming engine","Best option in 35k category.,Terrific purchase,A highly priced smart phone.,Cant get better at this cost. Review after one month of use.,Oxygen OS is providing poor experience, overall device is okay.,Ammazing Product,Okay","I am using OnePlus 10R 8GB 128GB more than one month. It is my first ever OnePlus phone. My personal review about this phone is as underPros1. Boxy design looks nice but feels not so premium but if you use its cover it feels nice. Cover quality is very nice.2. Screen is bright even in sunlight if you select auto brightness. Also screen color and touch response feels premium.3. Battery life is very impressive with 1.5 day backup with normal use.4. 80 watt charger is very fast which charge your phone within 30 to 35 minutes.5. I am not a heavy gamer but I tried asfalt 9 which runs very smooth.I think itll play heavy games smoothly. So it perform well.6. I am new to use Oxygen OS. I feels OS premium and smooth without adds.7. Rear camera shots very good pictures but selfie camera need some improvement which I think can be done via software update.8. No heating issue.9. Lightweight.Cons1. If you use without case, it doesnt feel like premium phone.2. I dont like the sound quality although is has dual speaker. You can feel vibration on its back pannel which feels very bad.3. Selfie camera needs improvement.4. Zoom is very bad on rear camera.5. No IP certification.6. No expendable storage.7. Paid theme store.8. Should have some dot notch animations like samsung.  At last I can say it is a nice phone with some cons, if you want OnePlus smartphone within Rs. 35000 you can go for it.,Terrific purchase at the price of 33k. Body I feel light htough it is not as usual OnePlus body as I had been the user of one plus in past also. Metallic sides could be a better option. Sometimes I feel lag in touch though it is for microseconds but it is there. Camera quality is good not awesome. Battery life is good i used to charge once and a day can be completed by itm Obviously, i bought it as it is one of the affordable option in terms of brand. Love to see metallic frames in coming phones. Storage is tremendous and speed is also good m Overall a good purchase a phone can be rated 4 out of 5.,This smart phone is good enough for daily normal use. But battery life is not good enough though is says 5000 mAh. Camera quality is not good enough in this price segment. Although its Oxygen os, it is not well optimised. From the starting there will be some lagging issue with some apps. Another bad thing about this smart phone is its form factor. The company taking around 39k but giving just a plastic body which will looks like below 20k. If someone wants to buy this i suggest to buy another model dont go for this model because of the brand. One good thing is oneplus promised three major android update and four years security update. Another bad thing its primary camera design. One of the three camera is so big that its embracing to say its price is 39k.,I would like to get directly to the pros and consPros.1 BATTERY  The first and the best thing about this phone is the damn battery life and how fast it charges. Its just amazing and I have been kind of spoilt by it now, I wont be able to adjust with a lesser battery performance and charging anymore!2.  CAMERA The camera is amazing and takes some really amazing pictures. No complains.3. LOOKS  The phone looks really beautiful. I got the forest green colour and it looks simply awesome and is eye catching and premium looking.CONS1 The overall working of the phone is not as seamless as it should be provided the hardware it boasts of. Having said that, the factor cannot be a purchase deterrent. Its otherwise quite smooth2 The absence of an alert slider was a disappointed. I was used to it on my 6T3Volume  Not too happy with the phone speakers. They somehow are not up to the mark.To sum it up Just go for it if you have a tight budget but want a premium looking, good performing phone. It packs too much for a 43k phone  good battery, fastest charging in the segment, premium looks, good performance.,Using the phone after two days I have noticed weird experience with UI, tapping on grey or black areas screen flickers to that portion and according to service centre its common issue across all phones and getting fixed by Oxygen 13 update as there were no issue with 10pro.So we have to do nothing but to wait for releasing the new OS update on the 10R and other models as well.Overall device working good so far I experienced average camera results,superb charging but not so extended battery life, touch sensor and speakers are fine and performance is good in my day to day tasks, hopefully UI and OS updates will help to deliver best of this phone.,Over all camera  is just ammazing I am a youtuber purpuse behind choosing this device is its processer dimencity 8100max its a supersaft max performence not even capturing while gaming also its runs very smoothly and its my FIRST PREMIUM SMARTPHONE Im the uploded photos20x zoom lg pic and I have uploded night and day liting pics to compareGood device from one plus,Its speaker is not really working well using it since 6months only plus it dosent comes with a warrenty plan it has to be brought separate camera quality is also okay not thattt good microphone is also been disturbing a lot while talking on the call other side person gets a lot of disturbance",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41pQ4gJMwEL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

Amazon said return window is closed on 7th night and now I need to call Samsung customer care directly for replacement.4. Called Samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely  couldnt identify the issue.5. Informed I will have to visit the Samsung service center to figure out the issue6. First visit to center, they did a software update 3 week old phone now  not sure what update would be pending and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week. They also whipped out the entire apps in the phone.7. Faced issues the very same evening, lived with it for one more day and went back next morning.8. Second visit, they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced.9. I requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesnt allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery, which was defective11. They told me I will have to contact Samsung customer case number again if I want a product replacement as they dont have the authority for that.10. Called customer care number again, and they inform me I have to contact Amazon for product replacement as Amazon was the seller.So back to step 3. Will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end , If I manage to reach there.Update 11. All customer care said they cant replace the phone. So surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement. They gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced. Again, whipped out of the apps which I had downloaded and logged in again.12. I checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and I figured the problem still persist battery was draining out by the minute. I showed it to them. They told me its a new battery and will take some time to stabilize. They also asked me to buy a super fast charger, while i bought from them to not take chances. They asked me to check for 2 days and confirm. Used for 2 days. Same situation. No improvement.13. Went back to them again. They checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now.14. Technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a 4 days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this. I have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true.15. By this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product, but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests.15. They kept the phone for 5 days and returned saying everything is fixed.16. Phone started functioning normally finally but I was sick and tired of the experience.17. I called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund. They refused with all their might and said phone is working now. During the process I also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for 5 days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for 5 days. I officially registered a complaint. But still no luck of returning the phone.Update on Nov 30th.18. I was traveling and outside the country. On Nov 21st while using the phone and with 70 charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some TV from 1980s. Tried switching of the Mobile and restarting multiple times. No luck. Still grid lines. My flight bookings, hotel bookings and everything one can think of, was in the mobile and my 3 month old phone is not responding to anything possible. Friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till I completed the trip.19. Reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center. Nov 30th. Am writing this update sitting at the customer care center. They mentioned patch issue. Software update dint happen . At this point, I know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation. No 3 month old phones screen will stop responding because of software update missing. They are opening the phone again to operate it, after again refusing my request for money refund.,Its really good smartphone in its range packed with features. And brand like Samsung never fails to amuse with what they deliver at a given price point. I still give it a 3.7 stars as battery  could be better. It also looses a point for not including a charger.,Phone looks are good. The charging speed is ultra slow even with the fast charger 25W original. Also camera quality is not even like 32 MP, total lied about 108 MP. Samsung UI is not very friendly and easy. Other brands have better and smoother UI.,Phone is very sleek, bought brown shade which looks much premium in hand at what it actually is....... Good budget model phone,you can not deny brand ,sumsung is a brand .overall good product for long use.,Good worck,Charger should have been part of it. But product looks good,Pricewise a little overpriced.Some of the cons are a little rigid fingerprint sensor, after 2 months of use, i frequently encounter a lag when unlocking the phone, battery life not up to the mark, struggles to go the entire day even with regular use, no 3.5 mm jack, and a buggy BT.Pros a very good camera, excellent screen, superb sound quality.If you somehow get this for below 18k, then go for it or else there are better options available.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418vxJS4AML._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

Pros are the 3 interchangeable plates for different ourposes. Grill one is just fantastic to hear all kinds of sandwiches and rolls and other food. All the plates are easily removable and washable too. Only con that i saw to this was the latch wasnt properly latching while making a heavily loaded sandwich in the sandwich maker. Otherwise its a top of the range product in comparison with other big brands!,All the 3 functionalities works pretty well. Only thing is it should have had auto switch off feature. Nevertheless it is a very good product and worth the money. Sandwich also gets made fast.,I ordered vguard removable plates sandwich maker, but it came in faulty.

New update details given,good tablet","first i would like to comment on the tab market of India. the most peculiar thing I have seen in India is, when a particular product is aimed towards students or education suddenly corporations go out of their way to milk money and under deliver as much as possible. it is exactly opposite to how students are given access to technology in the USA. you watch the prices of chromebooks, tablets, back to school offers in the US and compare them to India and it feels extremely unbalanced. after the pandemic there was a huge surge in the tab market and tier 1 brands started delivering garbage for 20000 rupees. snapdragon 400, old mediatek, 4gb ram, abysmal non ips screen for 20k just to mint money and take advantage of pandemic scenario and the circumstances of students. THIS TABLET BRINGS THE REVOLUTION.I am no student, but bought this for day to day use and I am an user of the normal big bezel 7th gen iPad, so my review will be comparative in nature. also i bought this at 23000 rupees so my judgements will be in accordance to the price I paid.1. if you are planning to buy an iPad, just buy it considering 64gb is enough for you and you use it for normie scenarios. you do day to day stuff you will be satisfied with your ipad with its everlasting updates.this tablet if compared spec vs spec give a good challenge to the ipad FOR 23K RUPEES. even for 27k it is fine.2. build is fine although I put a tempered glass on the 1st day itself. back is plastic but sides are metal and the back gets quite smudgy.3. the IPS screen is really good, there is no backlight bleeding, no dead pixels as you can see in the picture with the dark background. I am used to OLED screens on phones so at first blacks may disappoint but OLED is impossible at this price. the screen is better than my 7th gen iPads display. it is brighter, has more punchy colours, blacks are darker. on top of that 120hz panel, hdr certification, dolby vision support makes it great for content consumption. it would be a great device for xbox cloud gaming with the xbox controller attached to it. display is the part of the device with which you interact the most and display is the highest point of this tablet.4. snapdragon 860 is fine in a market where older mediateks and lower midrange snapdragons are dumped into the market. hence I say if you dont want this just buy an iPad but dont buy any other android tablet at 2030k price point. all are trash. 860 was fine with all those games which rule the market today. it has less pixels to push than in a phone and the bigger surface area helps in better heat dissipation so gaming is effortless.5. i cant comment on how the battery will serve me in the long run but for now i dont see any drain or backup issues with content consumption or gaming. it has a 22.5 watt charger in the box although it does support 33 watt charging. the bigger battery takes some time to charge with the inbox charger but my iPad takes even longer with its trash charger and it has a bigger battery and apple devices are extremely picky with chargers.6. the camera is okayish, just like most tablet cameras. the iPad has even worse cameras. for document  scanning it should be fine but other than that it is not much useful. it is still better than what samsung and lenovo gives in 25k range tablets.7. the second highest point of this tablet is its quad speakers. they are loud, have depth, are not sibilant and have brilliant stereo separation and soundstage. they are louder and punchier than those normal non ultrabook thiccc laptops which cost 4050k. they will hit you as a massive surprise. i did not at all expect such good speakers. they seriously outmatch those cheapo 700Rs boat, goat, mivi generic speakers in terms of distortion at max volumes, separation and low end. of course those cheap speakers would be louder and more shrill but it is about quality vs quantity.coming to the cons1. was it courage or something else that xiaomi couldnt find a place for a 3.5mm jack. not even a dongle in the box. they should seriously stop copying apples wrong habits and instead copy their good habits like long device support via updates. although I mitigated the issue by using portable dongle DACs like shanling ua1, ibasso dc03.....etc which i generally use with even my phones and my PC coz they are way better than on board audio of most devices except some devices like some LG phones with quad dac. i am an audio enthusiast so i spend money on such products and you need not. although it works with my old MI A2 dongle just fine.2. for 23000 rupees I dont expect the pen and people who are expecting a pen with 23k tablet should really open their eyes and look the disaster also know as Indian tablet market and its offerings but for 27k they could just offer a bundle where you pay 1k2k rupees more and get the pen as an add on.3. the accessory market might not be that vibrant. already there are no unofficial cases available from good brands. there is one from nillkin here on amazon and the seller has the audacity to price it at 5000 rupees LOL. the official xiaomi folio case is magnetic slap on at the back and i dont trust those type of cases.one more issue that I would like to point out is that xiaomi lately has a tendency to creep up prices by 5001000 rupees within a month or two by doing the good old GST BRO. so if it ever reaches 2829k for the 128gb version just close your eyes and buy an iPad with card discounts.so, in a nut shell for 23K it is was no brainer, but even for 27K it is a really good deal considering what its competitors are.hope this was helpful.,I have been using the Mi Pad 5 for over a month now, and am only glad that I didnt spend more on an iPad. Once the retailtherapy phase of the device wears off, what remains is the user experience. While it is true for both devices, I find that Im more at ease with the Mi pad 5 for the sheer look and feel of the content I watch in it. I also spend a lot of time reading books and illustrated designs PDFs and I often found myself amazed almost chuffed over how good the content looked. That display gets the accolades for a reason.The Mi Pad 5 largely meets my expectations and when people see this tablet, the immediate comparison they make is how much it resembles the iPad a gross generalisation. So, heres my take on Apples iPad 9th Gen vs. Xiaomi Pad 5If you have an Apple device already, and are especially looking to expand on the productivity element from the tablet, you need to stick to the iPad. Not just because it is going to regulate the standard, but you will definitely miss out on the features that ecosystem offers.So, buy the iPad if youare not concerned about the pricetagare looking at designing with the Apple pencil and are familiar with, or going to use ProCreateare making an investment with this purchase and will not be back in the market for a new tablet anytime soon.intend to use the tablet for presentations and want to take no chances with the devicehave a clear purpose for the Sidecar feature  if you dont use it despite buying the iPad, you are missing out!engage in a lot of official videoconferences and are prone to moving about and may accidentally go out of frame. The iPad has a feature that addresses this to an extent.are not expecting substantially higher results than the Mi Pad 5 from the inbuilt camera in general.have a proclivity towards the Apple design, their decisions and are generally happy with the software choices Apple makes for you.dont really care about features beyond a rigid list of activities you are certain the iPad is able to do and that this list is unlikely to change in the near future.looking for a reliable product that will receive Software support for a long period of time.are expecting the device to be used by responsible adults who are careful with the tabletare unaffected by hefty repair costs should the glass crack or the rear panel be dentedhave a need to use touch IDOn the other hand, buy the Mi pad 5 if youare looking at gaming on a plethora of titles that are on the Google PlayStore and perhaps not found elsewheredont care much about the stock iOS cookiecutter experience and think customization is the only way youll truly be happy with the tablet you use.want the best quality of video and photo capture from a tablet  meaning better video calls and video capture. This doesnt mean the camera will replace the phone you already have, but the Pad 5 is a tool that goes the extramile of taking good quality images, scanning documents and allows edits on its large screen.value videoquality from the Mi Pad camera than the AI that drives the facetracking function iPad offers.want the most of the audio experience, higher audio quality, clarity and richness.are expecting rich colour depth, HDR quality video experience and will be spending more than 50 of your time on the tablet watching videos.dont like limitations imposed on you, as with the software you use sideload APKs, rooting, Custom Firmware, overclocking, etc. If you do any or all of these, forget about the iPad.are mostly going to use it as a fun device to watch movies on or consume audiovisual mediaare not expecting to pay an arm and a leg comparatively to fix a broken screen or a damaged back panel.are okay without a fingerprint scanner and is okay with FaceID, PIN or Pattern for security.At the end of the day, you as a user of the tablet spend most of your time looking at the glorious screen of the tablet and interacting with what inside the device not the logo at the back.,The tablet is totally fine but sometimes is bucked out there is so many bugs bugs glitches I have contact to Xiaomi  they will try to fix it. One req dont upgraded after you buy dont have to do 13.0.6 . After the update not a single Google application is running on floating window and while split screen there is so many Black patches around the bar white bar sometimes. nice tablet you can go with it. And if you are thinking about productivity multimedia go for it because most mostly as student do presentation word Excel taken notes and all the things and handle easily were by this tablet and I am using it for games and other purposes it handle it quite nicely but you have to wait for Android l because Android 12l is good for tablet.New update is here.So the new Android 12 update is here unfortunately is not Android 12 l but is working fine all the bugs has been fixed few miner bugs are there but its totally refined from the past and system is working great 120 hertzs now looks amazing because animation bugs has been fixed and battery life is been fixed is now working more than 10 hours fortunately video playback and for day to day task you can go easily 2 to 3 days because I am doing PPT Excel sheet and other documentation its work totally fine and yeah thats the new update and go for xiaomi back 5. About pencilSo I bought xiaomi pencil for 6000 and if I say latency has been improved but if if you dont have the budget of 6000 go for another shopping site which name after f cart yeah and you can buy its fsmart buy pencil for 1500 rupees it works fine too and you dont have to spend 6000 you can go with the 1500 just you will not have those key features like taking screenshots and write something on it or double tap to note down..,over all i am satisfied with this tablet,",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31jUKdJdjHL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Stop working after 2 months.please dont waste your money on this earbud.,Good sound good bassall features is niceGood in room or silent place...some background noise come in open area like road... during travel...but this prob in all companies,Like at this price , but noise cancellation is not so good.,Good product for this amount, rarely facing issue while redmi 10,For my listing music and it has great quality,The sound quality is very clear and the range is very good but the bass is not that great",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31YW3+kpZQL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

Package was in good condition, thanks amazon. Was installed within a day. Writing this review after using the tv for more than a week.1. picture quality is good.2. Sound could be better. Dosnt mean its bad.3. connectivity is good.4. No issues with software or hardware till now.Overall a good product in this budget. Once again thanks Amazon and LG.,This is good smart tv,I wanted to get display for my PS4.  I was contemplating between a monitor and TV.  Since,  there is no need to get display with high resolution, I opted for this TV.  I have been using this TV for 3 months now.  Below are my observations when using this TV as a secondary TV or gaming TV.Pros1.  This TV comes with the software from the bigger OLED TV of LG meaning,  to some extent better upscaling.2.  Since I am using primarily as a gaming TV, I love the Game mode.  You can truly see the difference when you play with and without Game mode.  Pic and responses are shaper and faster with Game mode active.3.  You can connect Bluetooth headset to TV.  Great when watching movies as a secondary option.4.  LG service is the best!!!  The come probably the next day,  install the TV wall mount for free  Really quick and clean.Cons1.  No headphone Jack on the TV2.  You can connect a Bluetooth headphones to the TV.  However, for gamers,  the game mode is disabled when TV sound output is through headphones.  However, there is a work around for this.,,It is a good product from LG in range of 15k.Pros1. Bluetooth support for my wireless earphone2. Audio output is enough for room size of 1212.3. Wall mount installation is free of cost from LG.4. Smart remote in this range is really appreciable from LG. Doubt samsung provide smart remote this in this range.5. Picture quality is decent.,,,I love LG product and happy to buy this product with 15.5K. Its very good smart TV  with amazing features consist of Good processor, Smart Remote,  Good LCD screen and sound quality is also good.Recommended to purchase.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41WD+zBGibL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

Hold the center button for 2 seconds and the earphones with say in a JapaneseIndian womans voice, power On, battery about 70. She does not sound Chinese like the cheap Chinese headphones. Her voice volume level is not very high either.BT pairingTurn off the headset, press and hold to center button but keep holding the same button. The headsets voice will say, Bluetooth pairing. Once connected, it will say, Bluetooth connected. If BT disconnects, the voice says, Bluetooth disconnected.Next trackPress and hold the  button for 2 seconds and the headset will make a cute chime and load the next song in the playlist of any app. I like this feature of the chime because this way I know the headset has accepted the command and loading the next track. However, holding the button for 2 second everytime you want to change songs can get annoying and painful if you want to skip a couple of songs of just skipping endlessly waiting for the right song to play. Buttons arent very soft but do have a tactile click to ensure you feel the click when pressed.Power off just like power on, hold the center button for 2 seconds and the headset will turn off.Volume updown No audible feedback, just volume increase or decrease.Status LEDBlue when On and slow blinking when connected to bt. When in pairing mode, the same light blinks quickly in the same blue colour.Orange while charging. Solid on.Greenoff 90 and above.Physical clues tiny nub on the left ear plug to denote left side. Only reputed brands have it.Same tiny bump is made in the volume up button on the controller to denote volume .Coloured Dots on the plastic controller to denotr left and right channel.Ear plugs are colour coded and fit very well in my ears. Most of the ear plugs fall out of my ears while talking. These dont. I use the smallest one.What does Sony offerA very neat guide on how to insert the ear plugs in your ears the most comfortable way and ensure the best seal for clear audio. Ive never known that you can pull you ear up from the top corner and gently place the ear plug into your ear canal. Once placed comfortably, drop the ear and let the ear canal seal in.Audio App. Its basically a music player designed to detect the sony earphones. If you use spotify you can use this app to setup an equaliser. It plays MP3 from your storage too. My phone already has a built in Equalizer. I dont use any eq because the sound stage on these is flat. So all types of audio sounds great.FAQIs it flimsyNo, but feels like you might damage it if youre not careful.Does it really last 25hrYes, Ive tested it sort of. And never managed to run out of battery.How much did you spend on it1.6kAudio lagNone. I tested it with Android TV, LG web os, Android phone, ps4 and iPad. No issues of lag or disconnection or audio drop on super quiet moments of the song.BassVery decent and controlled.VocalsVery clearTrebleSharp and crisp.LoudnessYou can listen at full volume without much discomfort. But Id suggest not to.I compared it with JBL wave tws100. The sound is very similar but a we bit less bass on flat eq.80 Better than boat airdopes.30 better than OnePlus bulletsZ.,After using it for a week i returned it,heres my understanding,Pros,1.Music Quality mids and highs are well defined, if u want u can add bass from EQ ,that also provides bass with quality not boomy and unsubtle2. Fast Pairing  pairs instantly3. Hardware Level EQ  u can tweek it to your own desire4. Good Mic QualityCons1. NO MULTI PAIR SUPPORT.. i.e u cant switch between ur lap and mobile instantly or in standby2. Cable Quality  The Provided Cable are so thin and fragile, causes me to restrict my movements on wearing3. No Magnetic Tips for AUTO PLAYPAUSE.. If wear it to sleep, it cant be turned off by simply removing and sticking it together like other neackbands , u have to use or phone or the buttons to pause the music.Conclusion I returned it and bought realme neackband 2 though it was horrible boosted bass and mediocre sound Quality, simply because of better features, but i still prefer the SONY on music quality.,Grip to the ear need to improve,Good,The product is well packed and tamper proof packed with Sony hologram in the box.ConsThis is compatible with new edge Bluetooth version 5.0 so might not work with old phones like in my case with Sony R1 plus and xperia M.Works with Redmi 10 pro.in my case.This is not exactly band but LR connected with thik wire which might fall if jumping or during workout.Sound is 10 lower to Sony wired headphones.ProsClear and balance sound with Sony quality music hearing experience.Base feels sufficient and clear .not like uncomfortable.The connecting wire instead of hard plastic band makes it light flexible and weightless to wear and packing in the luggage.Mic clearity is 100 pure and your voice is very clear and sharp to the front person,not like others.Its complete value for money as this is perfect in its quality which many brands in this price tag is not able to do.This can be folded and packed in 4.Conclusion Go for it if you are riding and puting this inside ur collar not open, else it will fly. Not suggested for gym as it will fall.Function are smart and easy to useSimply it gives you the best quality at this price and connectivity with mobile is strong too.Not for Magic expecters ....YouTube  Insta  thevoyagerad,Sound quality is good.,Battery life is great with good sound quality.Audio quality of phone call is poor.

The drained water is same as tank water just with higher TDS. The water taste varies according to the level of TDS you choose very low TDS will give a good taste to water but at a loss of the mineral content of water which I will not recommend. The default TDS after purification is set somewhere between 80100 drinking water should have TDS below 300MANUFACTURER REVIEWRATING 251The manufacturer of this product is Eureka Forbes I am giving a rate of 25 because the product that is now installed at my home is a replaced product because the first product that I received was a defective one. The drain pipe would not stop draining water even when the tank was full, I asked the technician to check it and he said the valve is defective so I received a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT OUT OF THE BOX! I ordered for a replacement on Amazon which they processed and I got another one in which the led lights were displaced I dont know it happened during transport or it is some manufacturing defect I would have been disappointed for the second time but I observed it and reported to the technician who replaced the led lights to their original position so that the led indicators were now visible outside. The replaced products valve is functional and now operating without any hassle!SERVICE REVIEW05Dont expect to have a very comfortable installation experience its going to be a heartache. The reasons are1. The people Eureka Forbes has employed as technicians are thieves, I am saying this because Aquasure Delight comes with INTEGRATED DIVERTER VALVE, this is a stainless steel structure that is fitted to water outlet coming from the wall so that it can act as converter to be joined to the Aquaguard inlet! as I hadnt opened the package when it arrived! because some or many of the companies void the warranty of you open the box containing the product, mostly electrical items that need installation like TVs Washing machines Taking the precaution I didnt open the box so I was unaware that DIVERTER is included in the package! The technician after fitting the diverter charged Rs 200 saying that he fitted that from his side and diverter is not included in the package. i came to know this when I opened the package of the replaced product and found THE DIVERTER INCLUDED ALONG and confronted him but he defended saying some purifiers have diverter in them and some dont. I still have to confirm this with Eureka Forbes!2 The pre filter doesnt come included in the package so the technicians sell it to you at higher prices, My technician sold it to me at Rs 950 which is available at Amazon at Rs 750 but then if had ordered it from Amazon I have to install it by myself. I dont have a drill etc so I had to pay him Rs 950 so loss of Rs 400 on the technician. My opinion on this is that Eureka Forbes SHOULD SELL WATER PURIFIERA WITH PRE FILTER even though it raises the cost of the product by Rs 700 to Rs 800PLATFORM REVIEW!25The platform in which I bought is of course Amazon I am giving it a rating of 25 because I received a defective product the first time and Amazon refused to replace it because installation request was not raised by Amazon Amazon never raises an installation request unlike Flipkart which raises an installation request from its side, which actually makes your life easy as in case if you receive a defective product which you notice after installation Flipkart directly consults with the technician and may even resend him to verify the authenticity of the problem For installation you have to call the Eureka Forbes toll free number and raise an installation request, so Amazon representative was demanding an INSTALLATION REPORT, a video or photo proof of the problem, now how could I make that thief of a technician to write an installation report and about taking a photo or video I got the water purifier uninstalled as soon as I found it defective to put it up for replacement but I didnt know replacement request has these many hassles as it was my first time replacing an electronic product!SUMMARY1 PRODUCT IS GOOD FOR THE MENTIONED PRICE!2AQUASURE COMES WITH INTEGRATED DIVERTER VALVE A STAINLESS STEEL DEVICE THAT IS ATTACHED TO YOUR WATER OUTLET AND THE AQUAGUARD, DONT LET YOUR TECHNICIAN CHARGE YOU FOR IT.3 THE TECHNICIAN WILL OVERCHARGE YOU FOR PRE FILTER BE READY FOR THAT.4 TECHNICIANS ARE CUNNING AND MOSTLY THIEVES SO BE SHARP AROUND THEM.5 MAKE SURE PRODUCT IS NOT DEFECTIVE IF IT IS AMAZON IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A HARD TIME REPLACING IT.6 AMAZON WILL NOT RAISE AN INSTALLATION REQUEST YOU HAVE TO RAISE IT BY YOURSELF BY CALLING EUREKA FORBES CUSTOMER  CARE!OVERALL VERDICT 2.55,if your family in 4 members you have choice eureka Forbes delight ROUVTDS this product is very effective and efficient. Agua guard provides installation with in 24 hours of delivery. before the installation had TDS level is  125, and after the installation had TDS level is 62. Nice product by Aquaguard, water taste is also sweet.,This is very good water purifier but I see service guy for installation seems in hurry. He just installed and went off. He did not show how much is TDS, how to adjust it. Dont buy this product on Amazon. Buy it from local stores if possible.,I purchased this product on a heavy Festival discount. There was problem initially after installation due to defective water holding knob. I reported this issue and immediately replacement was arranged. Although I had to wait for about two weeks. The Serviceman came and installed another piece. Since then it is working excellently. In all, the best part was that the services were good and responsive.,Amazon part of the business was smooth.Delivery done within timelines. Payments, exchange, cashback all done hassle free.Eureka Forbes another story.For installation I had to call them daily for 7 days.Finally on escalation and on hold with Eureka Forbes customer service for close to 90 minutes, installation was done.Eureka Forbes now calls me every other day to force this review.My main reason for writing this review.,I got the Purifier installed and before that I was having Bislery water reason why I have so many bottles which thankful came handy. The Deliver and Installation was smooth. After installation the agent mentioned to let the filter fill up completely and then throw away all the 1st batch of filtered water since its the 1st time filteration process so it will basically clense it overall.So I decided to let it full up and once it was full, I turned off the switch so no more whater comes in. I used the empty 2L Bislery bottles to fill up the 1st batch of filtered water which as shown in the image which is around 6L as Mentioned by the Company.After I emptied the Filter to its last drop, I turned on the filter with another set of Empty bottles at the waste pipe side. It took quite a while to fill up the tank fully but as it did it filled up almost 13.2 L worth of bottles as seen in the image. This is roughly 220 or more than twice the amount of filtered water.Now the company claims 60 water saved in comparison to other ROUV filters and I have no knowledge of how much water wastage they do. But I think its a bit much regardless.Fir every 6L of purified water, it wastes 13L.My tal water TDS is 470Filtered water TDS is 86And the waste water TDS is 640Maybe its because of the TDS levels due to which it wastes as much water ky does and its possible that the amount might vary for different TDS levels at source.But I recommend to have the waste water collected and used for something else if possible rather than just letting it drain down. 13L almost everyday wasted is 390L per month and this is considering you only filter 6L of water per day.Ill redo this once more to see if theres any difference in values. This is juts to keep the potential buyers informed.,I like speed to fill water n less wastage. I like Tds adjuster and easy to install . I dont like internal plastic body though I believe its steel.. need confirmation. Overall good product we are satisfied having it installed from 34 weeks,Deserve a 5 star on product. However, ran into a problem when it comes to installation. The technicians of the servicing centre at my local area gave me a huge problem by delaying the installation. At last one technician came forward.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Anei7Di0L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

I am an oldfashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes  but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement  which is entirely nonnegotiable  is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games which do not need much memory or processing capacity. I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage. Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending emails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf  primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one M30, the new phone M33 offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage.  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an immersive listening experience and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers  because old chargers, like old handsets, add to ewaste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 6070 charge at the end of the day, and it takes 3040 minutes for complete charging one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging. It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10watt charger, except that it would have taken 6090 minutes for full charging.I conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone  but for my requirements. A word of advice if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.,With 5G connectivity, a 120Hz display and solid performance, the Galaxy M33 5G is Samsungs bestvalue smartphone yet under 20K segmentProsAlmost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 4.1 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love, none of the flagship grade features are skipped here apart from dex mode and spen features, Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading of apps, makes using one ui pleasure to surf acrossYou get features like ascreen recorder,video call effects, Game Launcher,Link to Windows,Dual Messenger,Quick Share,Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others.

It takes around 1.5 hours to go from 0100, and half an hour of charging can take the battery percentage to around 45 provided you have 25 watt Samsungs chargerDespite summer time, phone has managed to stay relatively cool, 5nm architecture helping its cause here12 5G BandsDedicated SD card slot is a plus herePD 3.0 25 watt fast charging support reasonable for price segment but we have seen faster charging speeds with other OEMsPromised 2 major android OS updates and 4 years security updates is a huge plus above its competitors, making this device more value for money in long runConsUltrawide camera is on softer side , lacks details compared to its primary sensor but manages to frame good shots that one can post on social media, macro camera is good with colors and edge detection but lacks depth of field and details , Note 10 pro which is brilliant in this caseNight shots are above average mostly grainy and muddled but better than most smartphones in its segmentLacks some stability in Video recording at 4kAmoled display could have made it unbeatableLacks stereo Speaker, but audio quality on single speaker is quite goodPreinstalled bloatwares like Moj, dailyhunt, sharechat, byjus are mild and uninstallable but makes mature one UI experience looks immature out of the boxCurrently device is not tunned for high gaming performance as limited FPS in popular games like BGMI and COD deters it away from being a gamer friendly device, but we can expect exynos 1280 to resolve over time and be more optimized for more games in future updatesSlightly cheap design , Chunky in size, carries some heft, Dated notch displayLack of charger in the box is a bummer, which adds up to the value cost proposition",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419KF2t1nML._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55 version.

No Dolby Vision support  which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99 of budget TVs in the market cant produce the contrast youd expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than nonHDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy.

No need to buy separate Robot for mopping, (B) Covers Full House in one charge, (C) Suitable for All Floor types especially Tiles, Marbles, Granite, Wood, etc|ECOVACS BRAND: Undoubtedly, ECOVACS is a leading Brand in ""Robotic Vacuum Cleaner"" category with excellence in R&D & Innovation.","A perfect balance of price and performance,Great Suction and above average mopping  Good Buy","Very happy with the product performance.Installation Very easy to start using. Had to wait for 2 days for the technician but with the instructions from box, you can start yourself without waiting.In the box 10 disposable mops, 1 washable mops, 2 side brushes, 1 main brush, Mopping plate, Deebot, Dust chamber with HEPA filter, Charging Dock, Cable, User Manual, Cleaning BrushCleaning performance Superb cleaning with 4 power options  Quiet, Normal, Max and Max. Lower suction means lower battery consumption. With higher suction power even the minutest dust particles will be cleaned up Good if you have children in the house. Higher suction also means you need to clean the dust chamber more frequently. In all the 4 power options, the house will look clean and will collect most visible dust. The higher options are for deep cleaning. Also if you have groves or areas that accumulate dust over time in the flooring, the higher power will pull out dust from these tiny places.Cleaning Pattern 1st edges of the room are cleaned and then it will run a northsouth or eastwest cleaning pattern inside the edges. No specific patterns like Y or SpiralMopping Performance The mopping also has electronically controlled water usage  Low, Medium, High, Ultra High. The app shows warnings when using High and Ultra High The robot may slip due to water on the floor but I have been using High water flow on ceramic tiles and have not faced such a problem. The wheels of the robot have good grip which help with the higher water settings. The mopping will become more and more effective over time with usage of the reusable mopping pad As it gets older, more area will touch the floor than a new mopping pad. For the 1st week, the mopping is not as good as the mopping pad does not entirely touch the floor but with usage the shape of pad will adapt and you will get better results.Corner Cleaning 12 cms of wall corners may not be cleaned, esp. if you dont have straight walls E.g. if you have a bathroom door, which has a 1 cm cutout in the wall, then the corner area around the door might not be cleaned. 90 degree wall corners may have a 12 cm area which is not cleaned, however the side brushes are large enough for most of these corners. All other areas with obstacles, such as chair or table legs will be properly cleaned Deebot may run around them 2 or 3 times.Corner Mopping As the Deebots mop is round, it will not reach the corners, expect a 56 cm area in the 90 degree wall corners not being mopped. However on straight walls, the cleaning is very effective as it may only miss 12 cms, which however will be cleaned by side brushes.IMPORTANT If you have black furniture, Black stone  wall tiles, mirrors or any reflective furniture at the height where Deebots Top mounted laser is located, the corner area near that black furniture will not be cleaned by Deebot. The laser is not able to properly recognize that it is a wall and will run a few centimeters away from that wall. This is important to consider if you have substantial amount of blacks in your house as the cleaning will be less effective.Mapping The 1st run will map the entire house and you need to follow Deebot as it maps so that no areas are obstructed. Subsequent runs will update the map with any obstacles e.g chairs and tables if they were not initially mapped. The N8 version does not have additional sensors as the pro version. So it may crash into smaller items that the top mounted laser cannot directly see. Also, you can save at maximum of 2 maps at a time 2 floors. The 1st run will be a very random cleaning pattern. After the 1st run, you can edit the rooms Divide or merge areas and rename the rooms based on some preset options like Living room, bed room, kitchen, etc.. Once the rooms are mapped, Deebot will clean each room in the subsequent run and then you will be able to see proper cleaning patternThe created maps are not editable you cannot move or adjust boundaries. You have option to add virtual boundaries as a line or as a rectangle box where the robot should not go. This is extremely useful if you have mirrors or reflecting furniture at the height of Deebot. Deebots laser reflects off the mirrors and assumes there is area of the house where it may be able to go behind the mirror. So you need to manually block this mapped area behind the mirror with a virtual boundary or box. Deebot will automatically detect carpets and not mop over them if you have installed mopping plate, then Deebot will ignore carpet area. Also there is an option to mark areas as no mop areas Similar to Virtual boundary.Application Use I used the android application for setup and regular cleaning functions. The app has an advanced mode, which works as per the stored map. If you turn it off, Deebot will start cleaning wherever you place it. E.g. I have a balcony which cant be accessed by the Deebot directly. I can pickup and place it in the balcony, turn advanced mode off and start cleaning. Once it is done, it will return to the place where you put it and notify that docking station is not accessible.The app also has 3 cleaning modes with advanced mode turned on. Area cleaning Select a room or multiple rooms to clean, Auto clean Clean the entire house, Custom Cleaning Select an area on the map to clean.You can preset the sequence in which you want to clean the rooms. You can also set different vacuum and water levels for each room or can use a common setting for the entire house. You can also preset how many times Options are once or twice you want to clean a specific room. You can also set multiple cleaning schedules based on which room you want to clean at what time of the day. Deebot will start working automatically. However, this is not advisable if you are mopping. As per the technician you must remove mopping plate after use. If any water leaks onto the parts, it may void warranty.There is an option to auto boost suction on carpets to Max. You can set the option for continuous cleaning, i.e. whether you want Deebot to auto restart cleaning if it runs out of charge midway. Deebot will only recharge partially based on the remaining cleaning area, resume the cleaning, and then return to recharge  this saves timeThe app also shows usage period of accessories in hours and the total expected usage time. It is an Ecovacs recommendation to replace the accessories  Side Brush, Main Brush, HEPA Filter. This area of the app also shows how to clean or maintain with images, which is really helpful.The app shows a history of cleaning cycles with maps. This helps to check if any areas were not cleaned.Cleaning and Maintenance Expect that instead of cleaning the house daily, you will be washing the mopping pad every day and Cleaning Deebot once every week depending on the size of your house. Cleaning will take around 30 to 40 minutes  remove all hairs from side brush, main brush and wheels, remove the dust chamber, remove the HEPA filter and wash the dust chamber, Wash the main and side brushes if needed, Clean all the sensors of Deebot with a dry cloth, Let the washed accessories dry and then reinstall them. Also, remember that the investment in a robot is not a onetime cost. You will need to replace the accessories every 612 months based on the usage and maintenance. Consider the replacement cost also while evaluating a price point for investment in a robot vacuum.Overall Rating 910 The cleaning and mopping performance is very good, and better than a house maid in most circumstances. E.g. Deebot goes under the sofas. Expect manual work such as clearing the rooms before running the cleaning cycle, and cleaning areas out of reach of Deebot. In this price range, I am very satisfied with the performance.,",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31Ly7OehCGL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

It has a 5m power cable that is long enough to use comfortably. The suction power is good at 16kpa, unlike the 6kpa of most batterypowered cleaners. Noise is okay, I mean it isnt so much to disturb someone until and unless someone is really allergic to noise.It has several components that helped clean my car and even my fabric gaming chair. And I was also able to see a visible difference in the window meshes.Yes, it gets heated after several minutes of usage, but I could use it with a wait of 23 minutes each time. Its weight is ample for horizontal and downwards usage. I havent used the stick provided, and I think it might be a little bit difficult to use it upwards on walls if I need to use it continuously for 10 minutes or more.I had to be sure that the accessories were available after purchase, such as the filter, which I was able to confirm with customer care. Its a good buy. Lets see in the long run.Its made in China. The company provides 6 months of an extended warranty if a review is given and shared with them. This is a bit weird requirement to go ahead with. However, this isnt a sponsored review and is based on hardly a months usage.Some photos are attached for help.,Nice product, but the filter strain was teared in one place, it needed to repair. But otherwise satisfactory. Build quality is very deplorable, they are just forcing the buyers to give 5 star by any means to give better service and warrenty assistance by a card inside the box, this seems really threatening. But overall working of this machine is somehow ok.I would rather suggest if you have options to not choose it, then go for that option.,Good for surface cleaning, build quality is not adequate but good to have at this price,",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31RLcOp57gL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws  which I had bought  with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments.

It is so sleek and compact in design with complete ss finish for safety use. Food is cooked in minutes because of 1000 watt. It is so good! I frequently grill my veggies, paneer, etc on this .

Review 1 is 30 days after purchase Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G only for Jio was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2 After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update Android 13Update received on 1 Dec 2023.Note After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there wereNo Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 Android 13 update reviewDelighters No new apps added. Absolutely NOT. System storage consumption remains the same 13.2 GB. Animations are more fluidic. More customization UI features added. Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder  lot more. Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier. Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor. Ability to play videos in the background  screen OFF as well even for YouTube  Really a welcoming  longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF Standby battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before. No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40 is too silent. No Dolby Atomos which was mentioned for OOS 13. Perhaps, to wait for Stable update. Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased. Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.Review 1Verdict  A Good Buy in this price range in 2022.Note This review is after a months usage. Received 2 updates during the course of time Recent update was of 0.98 GB. System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage. N77 band is missing for 5G. The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue. Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed.  In Nongaming aspect Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parameters.Things that are delighting Exceptional signal reception especially 4G carrier aggregation. Very fast download speeds. Insane Fast charging 0 to 100 in 40 mins, 30 to 100  in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge. No heating of the mobile just slight warming during charging. Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver. Oxygen OS  Color OSRealme OS  Bloatware. The skin is really good  nothing to complain like other brands UI. Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are uninstallable. No major bothering bugs noticed till date. Yes, the Alert slider is included, unlike some premium OnePlus models.Things that are annoying Dual ambient light sensor 1 in rear and other in front is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required. Volume level is useless until 40 level can be audible only in Pindrop silence ambience. Audible enough only post 40 level. Stereo speakers output are 70 bottom and 30  earpiece. But full volume doesnt distort  is loud enough. Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40 and best only  90 level Hotspot drains battery quickly even a warning notification pops up. Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm. Though the inhand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit. Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel. The inbuild DAC no 3.5 mm hole and only TypeC port is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.,Overall its a good mobile phone. The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long. Not much, i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 1820 hours on normal use.. not many themes available. Samsung is better in that sense.. there are many wallpapers and themes available. Display is clear and camera is also good! Overall okay.,I got this mobile 12Gb, 25Gb Ram variantat 31k after 3k discount on icici credit card.For this price its a must buy.I am using this product since last 2 weeks.The camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very well.The only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better, as a working professional it doesnt makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a day.If you have no issues with the battery section then just go for it.,Battery drains like any thing.

For any other information, please contact Amazon customer support | Wall Mount is not included in the box and will be charged extra at the time of installation","Decent product. Value for money.,Value for money,Improvements Needed,Everything thing good except the installation experience,Overall taking all aspects TV is good within the price point,Tv installation services,One among the good TVs in the market.,Picture","I am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.Usage Continuous, OTT only, no CableDish operator.Average daily usage 68 hours.The TV is a great valueformoney product.Installation The installation was simple and Amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hasslefree.Picture The picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a Sony, LG and Samsung with these kind of specs. Movies and especially hires TV series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hires , wouldnt look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of Sony, Samsung LG etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone elses better TV.Sound Sound output is decent. You wouldnt need additional support to enhance the volume as such.Remote Sleek, sensitive and userfriendly. Its exactly like Amazons remote.OS Same as any smart Android TV. Works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. Switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than Sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.Standalone and as your first smart TV,  you wouldnt find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hires from the beginning. It is a great value for money product without a doubt.However, if you are considering this as an alternative or second TV after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,Picture quality is good for this price, didnt faced any lag on UI and browsing other apps. Only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. Overall worth for money u spend. But the installation process is just awful, Amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. No demo given on Tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,Screen looks amazing but problem is with processor I believe. If 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickersnot so often but problem exists, even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.Reason why I believe processor is bad because I do 4k gaming using PS5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,If you buy TV in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. When you want to buy a TV from Amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. The problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. Its like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you cant eat. So I ordered my TV on Monday, it got delivered on Friday and it will be installed on Monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. If we had the technician details, we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.Regarding product, its good quality and very good for a average user. Heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, I guess.,This TV gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1 The installation guy didnt arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didnt came for installation purpose. So strictly be aware of this point.2 The TV I got in offer with 3k discount on ICICI card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3 Even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece I didnt got the replacement for the product and its totally unfair deal by Amazon and the seller too.Final verdict is the TV quality and feature are good but the service from seller and Amazon that is got was very poor inspite I was prime member. The seller DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases Amazon will not help you. Thankyou,Team,Also to be added TV installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. NO need to other subvendor to getting installation and demo. Also dependency on thirdparty involvement should be less.Bad experience with TV installation stuff.Pls look into this .,Picture quality good. Sound quality  not upto my 3xpectations. Not able to find the real Dolby stereo effect. Remote not upto the mark.4  for picture quality, 3 for both sound and remote quality,Good quality picture but it hangs on home screen",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hQfTroMzL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

A must buy for every person who is watch enthusiast.,Having a great experience","2 months review its been working fine, theres been no problem as of now.. some thingsthe whole step tracking thing, i bought it due to that reason, it didnt basically satisfy me to that level with that, but it does count steps accurately in the walking modeactivityIts got some scratches in it.. but its not that noticeable at first glancethe backgrounds, I believe it couldve been wayyyy better if we could change 45 backgrounds of 10, but we can only have 2, 1 customised and 1 download from the appwhich has limited options  the other backgrounds are just.. eh..the looks, Ill give it 910, its good looking stylish differenttouch screen is goodthe sleep tracking too is kinda accuratei still havent understood it that well lolbattery life is muah, I use it without Bluetooth and it easily survives for 67 daysspo2 and heart rate, I just believe what it says as i cant check prove if thats correct.the water resistance, I havent used it in water ofc am scared the calling feature works fine.. its got good sound overall its a decent watch and can be used in day to day activities, am quite satisfied with it as my first smart watch ,Ive used this product for 4 days, and im going to rate the various features and different aspects of this smartwatch which could help the customers here So, Bluetooth calling 45  the inbuilt mic of this watch is excellent and the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance, watch connects smoothly with the mobile and dont get disconnected automatically until you do it yourself through watch or phone. Only con is you cant silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.Built quality and looks 4.55  metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. Best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wristspoor me, with 5.6 inch wrist. Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.Touch screen 55  its almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. I bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.Accuracy 3.55  SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. Count steps with decent accuracy as well. Sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.To sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if youve a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,I recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the Bluetooth calling is excellent. The voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.The build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. You should go for this watch if you want a budgetfriendly smartwatch under 2000.,Its a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,I recently purchased the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, and I am very happy with my purchase. The watch is quite stylish, and I get compliments every time I wear it. The watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. The watch also has a great battery life, and I can go for days without having to charge it. The watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. All of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,This watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. Really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super . just go for it.,I liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, Heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a Ben 10 Omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41sHRWXCfvL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

So yeah.,Very good kettle and big in size,Cord length is good,It is very robust in temperature control. That is to say on and off manual and automatic off. Regarding cord, it is 1500 watts kettle which is on the top of ordinary Indian domestic non power 6A plug. They have given one meter quality wire  with 6A plug.  This means if your home wiring can stand 1500 watts on ordinary non power plug you can use it in any socket anywhere. The switch in the kettle is bit wobbly, not sure whether it is purposely designed so initially I was not pleased, now love it because of majestic performance,Product looks good. Value for money.,seems good until now... hope will last long... good purchase ,Kettle is nice  and cord length is also good but package  is not good,at the time of delivery it was opened,",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/310R9iLp3mL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I dont perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you or not in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy or avoid. Cheers.,Display  BeautyCamera  decentPerformance  AmazingBattery  ok in 5000mah u expect more tbhOverall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which Im using right now in this phone, but Ill keep update this review after 1month of usage!,Its a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting.

Tremendous battery life in heavy usage. Super cool device. Silky buttery experience with blazing fast performance. good sound quality. The form factor is really good. I mean the screen is flat, so it feels like a widenot actually wide but feels like phone also it is tall, thats why it really feels good at hand. I have an iPad but all the work now can be done by phone so I am happy.Didnt like it  As I had op5t i loved oxygen os, but now it feels like realme UI. Camera is worst for this price. Main sensor is good other two are useless. Company should provide a telephoto lens in this price range. I had op5t and previously op3t,both camera were good. Op10t camera is exactly same as nord 2t.Conclusion  if you looking for speed, performance, battery life, longevity, best of display, premium feel then go for it.If you are looking for OP experience like an alert slider, or a good camera then please dont choose this. Either u can wait for the next OP or go for other devices. if you dont bother about UI experiencei.e. oxygen then go for iqoo9tits far better in specgo to gsmarena compare op10r and op10t. exactly same specification except processor and charging speedthis much fast charge is not required by excluding important spec .,I am OnePlus user since their 1st phone. I have used OnePlus 1 , OnePlus Nord , Nord CE, Nord 5T and now 10T. I have been using 10T as my primary phone since last 1 month.  Everytime OnePlus never fails to impress with their new phone but this time you would feel something is missing may be because OnePlus has already raised their bar so much that user always expect more from them . When I saw 10T first time , somewhere in my subconscious mind I had taken my decision to buy this beast. But before I reviewed so may phones, from One Nord 2 to  iPhone 14.My ratings Design and build 910Camera quality 710Battery backup and charging time  9.510Performance 910Undoubtedly design and build is unmatched. So sturdy and beautiful. Camera quality might be discussion point. They should have given more in camera because phone comes in high range and premium level but current camera is not so bad. Noone can beat its battery charging time and backup time. Within 20 min 0 to 100 , highly impressive. It will survive around 1 day for average user. Performance is good , installed and ran multiple apps at a time, never faced any hung issue or app carsh issue.As I said , even if wow factor is missing this time, I would say good phone with nice overall performance , design and features. If you get it in sale around 40k its a good deal . Go for it , nothing to regret. ,Purchased it some days ago !!Switched from my Asus so I had really high expectations and well, it did perform somewhat close to it but also many downgrades as well, Im just gonna list as pros and cons !Pros   I mean snapdragon 8 Gen 1, you can expect amazing performance, why not top tier since its the best processor android could offer Well cause I feel the processor on this one is under clocked to reduce heating but its holding up pretty good in terms of gaming and other benchmark tests and stuff. Build Quality is actually good, Especially the back, the back does feel amazing and while holding it does feel like a premium phone, expect for the frame ofc, its made of polycarbonate but we can get a hang to it later. Software, Im not gonna sit around and cry about their merging with oppo, I feel its fast and a good ui, of course some old features not available now since Ive used a OnePlus 5 in the past for some weeks but we can get a hang to this new oxygen os, just hope its not completely turned to color os. Charging is just insanity on this one, switching from a phone which used to take around 2 hours to get fully charged to this one, almost finishing full charge under 20 minutes and Ive witnessed it several times, its just impressive but some issues and Ill talk about it in cons. Networking and connecting is fast and good! Havent faced any major issues in my networking experiences! calling is a good experience, connecting with networks and bluetooth is extremely fast, good overall.Cons  about the processor, like I said it is under clocked and the benchmark scores proved it a bit, although I dont care about benchmark scores and just want to keep my belief in real life usage so it is doing good. Polycarbonate frame and No alert slider Like really at least we deserved a metal frame at this price segment which is what upset me a bit, not really a big fan of alert slider so I didnt mind that part. the camera setup is so so so average and stupid, aside from the main lens, the wide and macro just did not make sense at all and are completely worthless in this segment, this is literally the same setup from Nord 2T but just a better software optimisation, front camera is alright too, nothing that great Charging indeed is one of the key factors in this phone but it takes a toll on the battery backup, usually in my usage I have to charge it 2 times for it to be used the whole day, it drains a bit more than I expected it to, also theres no option available to disable 150W charging to let it charge in usual speed to test the battery, only except for the night optimisation mode, which is kind of good in my opinion.Phone is a good segment in this price range and If you do believe in the particular brand image and its products then go for it. Although Iqoo 9T does provide a better camera setup with a bit more aggressive processor performance, but this device does the job too.,So , basically I am reviewing it after usage of 1 month and 2 days. I am giving it 4 star because of Alert slider missing. Lets me clear it by points.1. Battery is awesome. It will get full charge in 19 minutes 20 seconds. It lasts more than 25 hours to me.2. Camera quality is nice. Specially night mode is awesome. Some improvements should be done for selfie camera but it clicks nice picture.3. No lagging , no hang. It runs smoothly and very fast.4. Only thing that disappoints is alert slider that is missing in this phone.5. Video quality is awesome while you record and it is stable.6. While watching any OTT , streaming quality is awesome. You can fully enjoy it .7. Speaker of phone is perfect, even at lowest volume you can clearly hear the voice on call.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413c3ZnFLxL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

Just that the edges dont fix in properly. There is always air bubble kind of thing on the edge.,Easy to apply and no bubbles. For Rs 150 they send 2 units which is amazing too. Satisfied with the purchase !!,Overall good and easy to apply. Doesnt cover 100 percent of screen a small gap is there in edges,Adhesive could have been stronger. Popio has great screen guard at much better price.,See if you own an Iphone then popio is the best out there.I got this tempered glass because my last one broke during a fall from the stairs.  my last one was from popio too. So I odered another  the prices are a steal like seriously I wonder how do they manage it for so cheapBuy it without a doubt its a genuine product.PS I like little note they left with the product.,Fed up of buying those exaggerated priced tempered glasses and looking for near by shops to apply it.This product is priced for its value and lesser than other products in the market.Bought this product after scrolling for the best on Amazon and ordered it. Honestly I was never satisfied with any other product like I had with popio product. A big thanks to the team!Bonus is DIY. I never tried anything self before but after following their guide and videos I was able to do it right at first time. I really felt DIY is convenient and no need to worry about finding near by stores who could help us applyinstall it.,Got it for my iphone 14pro. Im using my phone with a ringke camo case and this screen protector fits inside snug.Install this glass with the case still on the phone else you may align it imperfectly and may cause fitment problem.Overall a good buy.,The quality is excellent. Refer to the installation video by scanning the QR code on the package it is very easy to install using the guide stickers. The quality is good, and it covers the screen entirely, leaving just enough space on the edges for the cover.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41XaIckgKIL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

People who call get out of coverage area message even though the phone show two bars of network .The same sim and network worked fine in my smartphone.Can use this as a secondary phone or as a backup device and cannot rely on it as a primary device .The only benifit which I saw on this is it supports VOLTE and can sync the contacts from Android phone which avoid manual taks of creating each contact manually .,Product is average. It doesnt suck like the many contemporary feature phones from other brands. That being said, its not great either with some little annoyance noticed.Dont expect much as its a feature phone but then some negatives are1 Theres a voice distortion noticed occasionally when receiving calls. Have to end the call  redo it, then the voice is clear.Initially thought it was an issue of a particular product. So returned the phone  got a new one.However the new one also has this. Have tried some methods to rectify this including switching off the volte . Till now this issue has not cropped up yet thankfully.2 No notepad.Come on, how hard is it to give a notepad on this phone. If it can do texting  contact saving, how difficult is it to give a notepad to record stuffs3 No YouTube.Since theres no dedicated YouTube app, tried to access it from the opera browser, but to a big disappointment, it cant properly load the YouTube page, let alone play any video.Yes its not a phone for constant YouTube watching. But since its a very important site, not only for entertainment, but also for information  news, it would have been great if youtube was enabled it supports 4g, so why not YouTube4 The camera is very bad.Cant expect smartphone standard camera, but this VGA camera is really bad. Nokia could have increased the price about 500 bucks,  give an average 1 megapixel camera on it.Sometimes we take photos not for posting on social media, but for information, like the name of a store or number of a vehicle.A basic camera that does that job is all that is required.5 Was delighted to see an English with Oxford app. Assumed they were very thoughtful to give an offline dictionary.But then upon opening, it turned out to be a demo version with Pay INR 50  Play 3 free trailWas even disappointed when upon clicking the free trail option, it required internet  was directed to the opera website.Whats the point to thisOther than this, the phone is not bad with some positive features like wireless radio, radio recording, big screen compared to other feature phones, voice recorder,  torch, call recording option, converter app, stylish retro design  a good easily typable keypad.,,All os Ok but battery life is not good .While we r not useing a single call also but its draining battery life,Good addon phone. Battery life is 7 days if usage is not very heavy. FM works without wired headphones. Call quality if good. Dual nanosim. No profile setting option as was the case with previously released Nokia feature phones. Preinstalled games but all except snakes are trial version. Internet browser, facebook, music  video player are there but no option to install any other app as there is no app store.,Gud for one model in Nokia and worth for money,Bettery not works more than 4 days even not using phone,It works like any other feature phones from the 20062010 time, but the build quality is considerably low. Good battery life and good call quality is there, nothing special other than that.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41tRgeQp9-L._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

I use Samsung M51, few months back my USB Cable was torn, so I wasnt able to fast charge. It took a decade to charge from 2090. Samsung original cable was too pricey and too flimsy, so I was searching for something durable. While browsing through the product page I was skeptical to place an order, as the company claimed too many features in such a low price. Keeping the negative thoughts aside I ordered it anyhow. The product was delivered well in advance, which made me happy.I unboxed and plugged in the cable, to my surprise the cable delivered everything that the company claimed. The ends have aluminum casing which makes it durable and away from regular wear and tear, it has LED indicator on both ends which turns on when the charger is plugged to the phone. Also, the box that it comes with has a secret code that you need to scratch to reveal which helps to check its authenticity.It easily fast charges my phone in an hour.

Nice Product  Highly Recommended.,Good quality and looks beautiful... I will surely recommend, After using it for 3 weeks. I use Samsung M51, few months back my USB Cable was torn, so I wasnt able to fast charge. It took a decade to charge from 2090. Samsung original cable was too pricey and too flimsy, so I was searching for something durable. While browsing through the product page I was skeptical to place an order, as the company claimed too many features in such a low price. Keeping the negative thoughts aside I ordered it anyhow. The product was delivered well in advance, which made me happy.I unboxed and plugged in the cable, to my surprise the cable delivered everything that the company claimed. The ends have aluminum casing which makes it durable and away from regular wear and tear, it has LED indicator on both ends which turns on when the charger is plugged to the phone. Also, the box that it comes with has a secret code that you need to scratch to reveal which helps to check its authenticity.It easily fast charges my phone in an hour. Overall, Im very happy with the product.I highly recommend this cable to anyone who needs a fast charging Type C to C cable.Will update this review if any change is observed.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41gztmbiIgL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Easy to handle...,I wont recommend it!!,Value for Money Product,Good Product,Low quality heater,Everything as per the description.","It is very beautiful looking and appears imported good for placing at one spot on office table etc. and not to be moved. It is very light so easily tumbles down. wire cord is very short. Heating is good. It is not strong and sturdy but made of plastic outerbody which will break if it falls down.,More than a week,im using this product.Proscompact,easy to use,portable,good built quality.ConsLight weight,No manual control over saftey switch,takes time to heat a small room,small cable length.ConclusionIf you are looking for a gud luking compact heater you can buy it.If you are expecting high skip it.,I like the product design  quality..Im using in my room.. It takes 15 to20 min to reduce the room temperature... I will recommend this product..,The only positive about this device is its price. Otherwise, all it has is negative.The heater is very light weight, but thats a negative coz its too light to trust it to work safely. A device working at such high temperature require some weight to have stability so that weay feel confident that it wont topple. The manufacture has given a safe switch at the bottom of the device, but the device remains at high temp for sometime even after being off.The material body material feels very cheap and doesnt give confidence that it would last long though the PTC heating element may last long.There is nothing to prevent entry of dust and fiber into the heater, that may lead to a fire in the long run if fibres accumuulate inside.Also, without any dust filter the heating plates will get blocked very very soon.The switch on the backside to switch off and on also appears to be of the cheapest quality.There is not temperature control in this heater....so once you start it it will run continuously so cant be used as overnight heater in your bedroom.So I would suggest, it would be better to go for slightly costly heaters which have temp control and better quality.,As abious amazon delivery service is awesome received this product in 2 days.Build  Built qiality is amazing dint expect this, Metal frame and smooth plastic finish, light weight to carry and portable.The best part I liked about it, it never took time to heat, just switch it on and it started blowing heat and it easily heats the room withing minutes. But bare oin mind it takes 220V power.All I can say is, its the best product in this price. You will not regret buying it.,The Heater is effective, easy to use , and very compact. Work is good, I like it very much.,Av very low quality heater without any temperature control. It burned my switchboard. It keeps drawing current without any control.,Great product for the price, considering it has ceramic element.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41C6ocE26pL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

Speedy and customer friendly approach from vu",",Screen quality is good.Its been a month I bought it still working fine.Two main negatives are1 It doesnt have default option to directly start on tata sky tv, we have to select hdmi option from input menu to select tata sky which one is plugged in.2 dosent allow us to commandchoose volume up or down from settop box remote mine tata skyWe have use tv remove to change the volume setting.Other than that great tv, mine ps4 works fine with it great graphics.Conclusion If someone asks me to if they Can buy it or notMine answer will be nor yes nor no.If we you want kinda cheap but decent  quality tv and taking the risk on unknown tv brand on their reliability just like me  then go for it.Better then Samsung or Sony  Definitely no!!.,I always buy and recommend Samsung Sony or LG for TV. But, I had a hard budget this time and chose Vu because my friends have been using it for at least 45 years without much issues.While the delivery and installation were excellent, and TV on the whole is a decent package which gives good clarity than the rival Chinese TVs and Sound, smart features are poor here.You can connect Bluetooth headphones but no option to disconnect them. I had to pair and unpair everytime.There is no voice command button on remote. Even while using the screen button for voice input, nothing gets recognised. My 3k Fire stick voice recognition was tooo good.,I purchased VU gloled 55 inches TV after suggestion from my techie friends and online study. Technician from amazon came to my home for installation in drunken mode. But I compromised with him due to busy schedule of work. He installed tv with his small screws instead of VU standard wall screws. He did whatever he want. Proper installation was not performed.I just calm down then later i gave a complaint to amazon and VU Customer services. Amazon was not properly responded till now. But from VU side i got a huge response of problem solving. Min 3 to 4 customercare executives spoke with me, finally VUs vice President mr prashanth phoned me and apologized me for inconvenience happened to me. He told drunken technician is not from VU. I feel good for VUs Top level executives have interaction with me. From bottom to top level VUs Team in touch with me for a month to resolve my issue due to i stayed away from home. Before few days back technician came to my home again from vu. He reinstalled my tv in perfect position with dedication. I never expect this much customer friendly behaviour from VU Thank you very much VU. Kudos to VU Team...",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41pdZIhY+gL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

It supports Samsung Smartview and DEX out of the box which means without any internet and wifi etc you can directly cast your screen. Super handy. The sound quality is just so so great for the price. The Remote gets synced with the Airtel DTH and there is dual band support. The HDR gets detected and auto upscaled for Full HD contents in the Hotstar and Netflix. The only cons I find is the power usage which is 100Watt and the smart assistant is pretty useless. The WebOS btw has all essential apps.About VU Installation is done same day. i cant comment on the durability and future support now. But thats common for all TV comps today except Samsung, LG, Sony and Panasonic.,All fine but remote is a pain. Its too ergonomically faulted for elderly people. Also webos is not the greatest and user friendly.,Good,Really good product overall, bit different from android tv but work almost simler to google or android tv.only feedback is screen mirror feels little bit legging and it would be good if we get mx player in store.,While placing Orders, I asked for Exchange of old Samsung 32 TV, And 2 years Extended Warranty for New TV.

But my experience was not perfect,Good but not best  !,Decent tv for the price but misses on basic smart features,Perfect one in our budget. Speedy and customer friendly approach from vu",",Screen quality is good.Its been a month I bought it still working fine.Two main negatives are1 It doesnt have default option to directly start on tata sky tv, we have to select hdmi option from input menu to select tata sky which one is plugged in.2 dosent allow us to commandchoose volume up or down from settop box remote mine tata skyWe have use tv remove to change the volume setting.Other than that great tv, mine ps4 works fine with it great graphics.Conclusion If someone asks me to if they Can buy it or notMine answer will be nor yes nor no.If we you want kinda cheap but decent  quality tv and taking the risk on unknown tv brand on their reliability just like me  then go for it.Better then Samsung or Sony  Definitely no!!.,I always buy and recommend Samsung Sony or LG for TV. But, I had a hard budget this time and chose Vu because my friends have been using it for at least 45 years without much issues.While the delivery and installation were excellent, and TV on the whole is a decent package which gives good clarity than the rival Chinese TVs and Sound, smart features are poor here.You can connect Bluetooth headphones but no option to disconnect them. I had to pair and unpair everytime.There is no voice command button on remote. Even while using the screen button for voice input, nothing gets recognised. My 3k Fire stick voice recognition was tooo good.,I purchased VU gloled 55 inches TV after suggestion from my techie friends and online study. Technician from amazon came to my home for installation in drunken mode. But I compromised with him due to busy schedule of work. He installed tv with his small screws instead of VU standard wall screws. He did whatever he want. Proper installation was not performed.I just calm down then later i gave a complaint to amazon and VU Customer services. Amazon was not properly responded till now. But from VU side i got a huge response of problem solving. Min 3 to 4 customercare executives spoke with me, finally VUs vice President mr prashanth phoned me and apologized me for inconvenience happened to me. He told drunken technician is not from VU. I feel good for VUs Top level executives have interaction with me. From bottom to top level VUs Team in touch with me for a month to resolve my issue due to i stayed away from home. Before few days back technician came to my home again from vu. He reinstalled my tv in perfect position with dedication. I never expect this much customer friendly behaviour from VU Thank you very much VU. Kudos to VU Team...",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41pdZIhY+gL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

Via chromecast app  project only selected media pics, videos or entire phone screenWays to connect PCLaptop 1. Windows cast option  project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option  need to be connected on same WiFi network2. Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service  Awful1. The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws  which I had bought  with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline  Please do not avail the so called free installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are its pros and consPros 1. Great picture quality. Its awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons1. Remote could have been better. Cant use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, its a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older  no issues yet. Its running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall its good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p HD Ready TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphonesearphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesnt happen automatically after a  restart  which means I have to remove and rediscover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 23 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range11499it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is goodsometimes lagging.No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money. Good product,Very nice productSave money",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/515t5K7hdqL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

No words for its outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery  for 45min  5 charging gets discharged used for quora, twitter, pininterestFor 18 min  5 dischargedused for upto 500mb gaming appsSo, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display  very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesnt occur again.Edit  It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip  Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting  screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating  I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, its not much.Want to know how much heat I feel Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance  No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesnt lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didnt play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip  Just because,  some people got defective piece doesnt mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploadedNow like my review, if you found it helpful!,Good smartphone for daily use, good battery life, doesnt hang much.

It needs a lot of software updates to fix bugs and bad design choices. I returned the watch after a days use because the features didnt warrant the price i was paying for it.The same notification appears twice in the watchNotifications that i have cleared from my phone dont go away from the watch and it even vibrates randomly, showing the old notifications.When i want to clear a notification, i have to swipe to the left for the delete icon to appear and then tap on the delete icon. Why the extra step Why not just consider swiping left as a removal of notificationsCalls on the watch only have the reject button. There is no button to accept the call from the watch.Google Fit Sync doesnt workYou can only store 5 watch faces at a time. Also the variety of watchfaces isnt a lot, which is probably understandable because it just releasedWith a couple of software updates  this would be a really competitive watch, hopefully they dont abandon it, like they abandoned updating the OnePlus Watch, watch at 4499 Price I have used City Bank credit card for availing discount,,The functions are super smooth although the Nhealth app sometimes does not track exercise, overall the watch is great product.,Plz update and add call receiving option",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31OgHTags6L._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

I mostly use it to make whipped coffee but Ive also used it for mixing protein powder in milk and frothing milk  creamer for coffee.It is incredible effective for exclusively liquid substances like milk and creamer I realized this after overfrothing my creamer one morning to the point of pure foam lol. After that I kept it in mind and I know to only do it for a short amount of time. Super easy to use, versatile in what it can be used for as far as liquids go, and tbh it just looks really cute on the coffeemaking section of my counter. The stand is a hugeeee plus, I definitely wouldnt purchase an alternative option without one.It gets the job done for whipped coffee.I also use this product to blend my matcha powder and my turmericcinnamongingercoconut milk powder lattes. This frother takes out all the lumps and bumps. Because the resulting blend is smooth, it does not waste the ingredients like stirring with a spoon. So, so great! It has made my favorites even more practical and delicious. I have not found anything about this product that I do not like. I would recommend this product to others and have already done so. Get it!

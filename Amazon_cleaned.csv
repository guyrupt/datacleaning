it is much nicer compared to gas stove where you would need to turn off, light up again and then find right flame again... here you just press pause again and cook as before... but that is only thing that i love. otherwise i hate how it is designed.... first basiclly whole top row of buttons is useless. those buttons are preset temperatures. but anyway those temperatures are wrong or just for items you do not cook... like there is stirr fry button and it set <number> c. it totally burns onion... i set usually <number> c for beginning and then soon change for <number> c. but even <number> c is too much burning... but lower setting is only <number> c which is not frying at all. i would need like <number> c i guess and it is impossible to set ...also i noticed another issue that stove is sometimes making automatic pauses. it heats and than probably when it thinks it is too hot then it stop completelly and in like <number> seconds starts again. so instead of consistentn temperatures it is doing on and off.but back to controll. except from fact that preset temperatures are useless when you want to change temperature it wont let you or let you to do only one - but not <number> times -. why i dont know probably ill will... you need to first press manual button which change temperature completely to <number> c and only then you can freely press - and set your desired temperature. so basically i never use any preset mode and i always only press manual and - to set my temperature...another control is setting time. i must say satting time is useful feature and i love it, but how it is implemented i hate. when you press time button then by default it set <number> minutes... ok but when you hold - button it jumps so quickly that in one second it counts to <number> and roll to <number> hours.... holding incrementdecrement is so quick that it is useless. it must have implement some idiot... anyway you can always click one by one. so to set <number> minutes you must click time button and then click <number> times minus button to set <number> minutes... it is doable but pretty annoying. or i long press - it usially jumps directly to <number> hours and then i press <number> times ... still anoying but i save like <number> clicks... what is super idiotic is that when i want to add <number> minutes i click time and it by default set <number> minutes again arrrrggghhhhh.... so instead of just click time and <number> times i need to click <number> times - .... really this must have done some idiot.... another unpleasant thing is that if you need to change temperature you can not... imagine something starts burning and you need to wait like <number> seconds and not pressing - and then after those <number> seconds time setting mode is automatically left and it will let you change temperatures again... when controlling stupidity is burning my food it makes me angry so over all i would buy anything else next time... maybe it will be worse but i would at least try...anyway to say something positive at the end i like that product looks quite durable and material quality looks good. packaging was also well. but power cable is only like <number> meters.... that might be too short... but for me just enough... also i like mechanic buttons, some stove has capacity buttons which is cool looking and totally flat but i like to feel the press and the click. buttons are under foil so there is no risk of something leaking into them. cleaning is very easy cos it is almost flat cleaning experience is much better than cleaning gas stove...,product is good but service center problem not available nearly.,no1,ordered <number> one was faulty",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Bnylq337S._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

winter uses, i recommend buying convection type heaters with fan and thermostat. please avoid conduction based ones they can consume less power, cheap but they are very slow, plus burns oxygen. also

year warranty for the productthe room heater uses a powerful fan to spread the heat. no swing option, very directional. you must position it correctly and securely. the thermostat option is good to have, and i suggest buyers to buy with thermostat, as this will help reduce your eb bills, as well as give comfortable weather inside. the thermostat is not very accurate, like in air conditioners but works. the user manual gives clear information about using it.how to set up power on, select <number> w2000 w the switch is not easy to operate set to thermostat switch to max anti-clockwise let the heater run till you feel comfortable warm inside reduce the thermostat slowly till the point where the unit turns off leave that setting undisturbed and let the heater on till morning-- note, if you have mistakenly set it wrongly, turn-off and turn-on. once again follow the same step above.i use this for my sleeping room which is about <number> x12 size. in bangalore, it is about <number>-<number> deg at night and can drop low in another few weeks, and it took about <number>-<number> minutes to bring it <number>-<number> deg with <number> w in almost closed room. please note, if your place has a room temperature not outside temp well below and it not exposed to sunlight, then it will take a long time to reach comfortable temperature. in such cases only use <number> w setting. it does not burn oxygen but reduces relative humidity which can cause dryness, so keeping a bucket or a better a tray of water will help. but you must keep your window slightly open, never use it on a closed room.5 a or <number> ai see this as a main problem, as in many of our houses, we only have <number> a for washing machines and ac socket which is not easily reachable. this unit can only be plugged into <number> a socket. the reason is, when you operate a <number> v, unit with <number> a socket, you can only draw a maximum of <number> watts <number> v x <number> a from that socket. however, since this unit operates also at <number> w, it requires <number> a, as that could only provide up to <number> w <number> v x <number> a like acs, etc. however, you can safely use this unit from a normal <number> a socket only if you are using at <number> w always. just buy a <number> a to <number> a converter socket and use this. do not worry, it will work just fine, but never use <number> w though if you house has mcb tripper, then its much safe.tips always keep some space from all <number> sides of the heater unit first try with fan unit for <number> minutes before using for heater using after a long storage keep a window slightly open for fresh air air can feel dry after sometime, can cause nose irritation and dryness. room must be ventilated, adding water tray can

.,good,httpsm.media-amazon.comimagesi61 gxdsye-yl.sy88.jpg,hi,i purchased this usha <number> t heater which got delivered to me on <number> th dec <number>. we use it moderately for just <number>-<number> hrs in day.it was working fine for <number> days. however,on <number> th day i.e on <number> jan22 night, after around half an hour of running it suddenly started making khad,khad,khad... sound and all its coil were red hot. since we were awake, i just switched off the power from main switch. it could have resulted into burning or fire, if i would have delayed for few more seconds.when i picked up the heater in hand, it looked some part was loosened inside.then on the next day, on <number> th jan <number>, i lodged a complaint with usha customer care, na di was told the technician will visit within <number> hrs. however, no one came in <number> hrs. so i called up the technician on the number shared to me by usha on <number> th. after that technician visited me. upon checking he found that out of <number> fans, one fan has loosened completely and fallen inside, that is why it was making sound and coils were getting too much heated.i was relaxed that its not a big problem and would be fixed quickly. but to my surprise, the plastic coupler to which the fan was screwed, is not able to hold the screw tightly. there was a problem with the coupler. what kind of quality it is that within few days of usage screw automatically loosenrd and coupler not able to hold it anymoreadding to my surprise, the technician was not having the new coupler for replacement. he said he will check tomorrow and come back of part is available. but he didnt came back. when i called next day, he said part is not available and has informed the company, but cant say when it will be available.so i called usha customer care again, and they said yes techinician has reported part is not available na dwe are forwarding your request to service team to arrange the part asap.since then i have been calling usha customer care as well techinician everyday and both are throwing the ball on each other.usha customer care is worst saying everytime that they are forwarding the request to concerned department and as soon as the part is available it will be replaced. i asked them how many days it may take as i cant keep on waiting for a month, they just said they cant say when it would be available.since it is too cold nowadays, and heater is not working what is the use of purchasing this usha heater.if they will replace it after a month, winter would have already passed by then.this is a worst after sale service from big brand like usha, and it was not expected from usha. if they dont have the basic parts available with the service center, what is the use of sending technician empty handedfrom now on, i will never recommend usha to anyone, and if any usha representative is reading this post, i request to them to service my heater asap.thanks,go ahead ,the

82,camlin elegante fountain pen - blackbluered,handcrafted with gold plated nibbrass cap chrome bodyelegant design,"good pen at low cost,... have been reading about this pen which i would like to answer,decent at this price,very nice.,not for speedy write...,nice pen good quality could be more smoother,smooth,superb fountain pen for all types of users","first of all delivery of amazon it was as specified no delays. hence, appreciate it.packaging not good. the box was tempered, torn and damaged.product ordered black, received brown. didnt replace as the color didnt much mattered. issue is with the seller though.performance the pen of good. robust, feels cheap however, looking at the price not to complain. writes smooth.for anyone who wants to enter into fountain pens, can start with this as it does the job.edited have been using this pen for over <number> days now, i am facing issue of nib dryness. if i dont use the pen for sometime. the pen doesnt write at all. i have to wet the nib or do something or the other in order to make it start writing. it writes great when it starts writing. but the initial pick up is really bad. i have a platinum preppy too. its a better option to go with if the budget is tight. however, there we have good writing but bad looks.,few points i have been reading about this pen which i would like to answer. compared with two other pens- parker vector and luxor v51. grip read in couple of reviews regarding the thick grip and the curve at the grip which makes it awkward to hold. honestly, have not felt so at all. the grip is pretty medium, larger than parker vector and comparable to the luxor v5. it wont create any problems holding it. i am an average <number> and people of same build, hand and finger size wont be any problem. also on parker vector the metal body starts to feel slippery due to metal, small grip and feels tiresome after writing couple of pages. been nice to hold the elegante and feel firm in hand, it makes one feel like holding a pen with substance <number>. nib and feeder it says fine on the nib and it is comparable to the luxor v5 <number> and parker fine nib. few claim it is <number> medium kinds. its all about the pressure on puts when writing it. i just touch the nib on paper and rest the pen does, so would say- it is fine. it is way too smoooooother and fluent than parker which felt a bit rough. parker fine nibs give a feedback making it bit of a dragging experience. however on elegante the nib just flows and slides over the paper. it is not only the nib but also the feeder which ensures the nib slides. the feeder ensures that there is even flow of ink through out the writing experience. the writing it leaves is slightly wet and not dry, personally i prefer that over the dry and dragging. this ensures that one gets to write about <number> pages i.e <number> sides without a refill.3. plastic construction and feel in hand the cap is made of brassas they say. the cap has a matte finish, not a glossy one. the clip and top is glossy. gives a fair enough good contrast to add some looks to it when taking it out of the pocket d . the pen itself- very much plastic. if i try to weigh both the cap and pen separately, roughly they feel of same weight, it is that light weight just a feel factor how i felt. however this does not mean it is a cheap construction. it has fallen from <number> floors down and did not crack anywhere, so would say its good strong plastic. it makes one feel pretty solid holding it. the size if compared to other two is larger. it rests pretty well in between my thumb and index fingerwhich parker does not, luxor does , hence never needed to put the clip on the rear. without the clip it is very much balanced parker and luxor both feel well balanced without the cap placed on top , with clip elegante and parker feel a bit -top heavy.4. ink filling personally always been a fan of eyedroppersgood old school days , however this comes with the standard piston filling as seen in the photo by hari. when i immersed the nib in the pen and pulled the piston it just filled half. had to dip the whole nib till the grip when it got filled. in parker just dipping the top nib was sufficient. for luxor pulling the whole top part out and then refuel it seemed very tedious. some other reviews i read people have tried removing the piston converter and used it as eyedropper!!! few said it worked , few said it leaked. need to substantiate it. not sure and hence wont try this out to spoil such a nice piece. if anyone has tried would love to hear your experience.5. writing after <number> weeks for luxor, it works immediately! even after <number> months it worked like magic. for parker bit of dipping, or couple of splashing out and it starts. for elegante it did not start immediately. from school days used to have an airmail unfortunately misplaced it when i shifted it used to work like a beauty even after <number> weeks. elegante on this aspect did not fair so well. however, how many of us are not going to use their pen for <number> weeks, always something to write, sign or pen down . it worked fairly after a break of one week.6. colour personally the looks of a pen hardly matter to me. its the balance in hand and the nib which are the real heart and soul. we pay crazy on high class pens just for the looks. for few people this matters more- individual choice and nothing against it. parker gives a good classy look, luxor makes one feel more of a student than a person with authority or executive. elegante would be a mix of both and middle of both. neither a college going look nor an executive look. on looks it does fair enough justice- the cap and two metal rings is all that makes it stand apart. would have loved if they would have made more colours than maroon, black and blue. nonetheless these colours are the royal colours and pretty good than what reynolds have- bright designs which are more for school going kids to attract them. this does enough for me.7. spare nibs and feeder not sure if there are spare nibs available online. i am at a location which is <number> s of km away from any civilization in a jungle or a desert and only way is to order online thankfully speed post delivers faster than couriers lticaptd . after using this nib, i would personally not place any other nib. i am pretty happy about it. always good habit to have spare nibs, dont know when one drops it and needs to change.8. recommended for its a must for student. at this price range where one is still studying and not earning, this sounds a good buy, though not the best as luxor beats this is vfm. parker, would never recommend it for students. if someone wants to carry it for exams- carry <number> atleast, all due to the limited piston converter capacity. luxor- would be best. if you are an executive sitting in a board of meetings where you want to make a statement by what you carry then there are many other alternatives. this is fair on looks and pleasure for writing <number>. value for money for a standard person like me or a student, luxor beats elegante and parker. however for a fountain pen- this is an excellent vfm well, this sums up my experience after using it. anyone has anything more to add to this or share their side we all would love to hear it, first of all, it came in a really bad condition. the package was almost flattened. all thanks to the people connected with the transition and delivery. thank god it doesnt have any dent. secondly, it is probably a used product. because it came with the smell of ink in it out of the box. thirdly, the brand claims that it is having a fine nib, but probably according to the european standards. i am a pilot lover, so i know what fine nib is. this is medium sized nib at its best according to the standards of pilot. using a pen with fine nib is like having a perfect orgasm. you remember the experience for a long time. the handwriting also becomes better. thats lacking in this pen. thankfully it doesnt squirt ink every now and then like most of the other cheap fountain pens. i had two wingsungs. those were unbearably squirty. fourthly, the grip is average. fifthly, if you are a beginner, you may go for it, as it will obviously let you get used to the fountain pens. you may use it as a day to day pen.but dont stick with this one only. explore the world of pilot if you have the budget. trust me, you wont look back to a pen like this. i was gifted a pilot crocodile fine nib by my mom. i want to keep my memories with this pen safe. so i dont usually use that. thats why ive bought this one. lastly and most importantly, a suggestion to the buyers, to make your pen experience ergonomic, please dont put the cap on the backside. open the cap, keep it aside and unleash your writing...,very nice pen., its really amazing very smooth writing.thank you seller amazon.,its not for speedy writing, if you are use for signature its cutting off character,...., some time spread over ink. and some time character cutting.... cheap plastic product but at a <number> good for beginners.,ive been using this pen for about <number> monthsprosbuild quality for this price is amazinggold nib looks amazingconsnib comes out easily,just that the neck area of the pen was little broad for me to get used to ..,guys i have started using fountain pens again a few months back. i had used all types of fountain pens during my school days like college brand eye droppers, camlin, parker made in usa, hero china made. recently i am using platinum preppy which is very smooth and excellent pen and yes expected since it is japan made. this the camlin elegante is our very own made in india pen. it makes us proud. just superb

keyboard,not worth the hype, but manageable,a robust, high-quality, ergonomic keyboard.,the best keyboard for a mac environment","so i got this keybaord a few days ago and it came in a package that can be best described as being mauled by a bear. it was totally beaten up and inside the batteries of the keyboard ha come loose alsothough i could just pop it back in no problem. thankfully it works fine, i tested all the keys and they are functional so lets get to the meat of the subject, or paneer if youre vegetariani think this keyboards performance will vary according to your use case. for me the primary objective was to get an android compatable keybaord since i had shifted the majority of my wokrload from my laptop to my tablet. i checked the internet and settled on this little guy becaue of teh glowing reviews and from my friend who had the ink variant of the keyboard. i bought it along with the logitech pebble m350 wireless mouse since it came in a bundle and honestly i dont regret it. both of them fir very well into my work type and theyve made my life a lot more easier.this is of course a bluetooth keyboard and it does not have any wireless dongles hidden away in the chassei checked. the keyboard has no backlighting as expected from a wireless eyboard that runs on regular pen torch batteries, and from my friends experience this battery will last you a long time. the major feature of this wireless keyboard over the other brands in teh market is the ability to switch between <number> bluetooth capable devices with the press of a button. now i personally thought that i wouldnt be using this feature all that much since i was plaaning on using this keyboard for my android tablet. but then i realised that, i could set up my laptop as a second device and switch between my tablet and laptop without any issues making it easier to type out papers on my laptop and responding to texts, emails on my android tablet at the same time. nowadays i cant stop using this feature since i have my phone, tablet and laptop paired to this keybaord and my productivity has become much more efficent. it is honestly very neat.the keys are rounded which is much more pleasant to type on than lets say square keys, and the slight inclination of the keyboard serves as good angle that reduces finger fatigue while typing. this comes with no wrist rest so people who have had hand injuries should either look for another keyboard or buy the wrist rest seperately. teh keys are membrane keys and they feel a bit stiff in my honest opinion, but nonetheless it has a good feedback and the typing experience is very comfortable. it does not have a number pad as you migth have seen from the product images, so if you are someone that crunches a lot of numbers ine excel you might want to skip this keyboard.the latency is quite low from my perspective, i dont think they have that crispy logitech lightspeed tech built into it though, but you wont be using this for gaming, and if you are planning to then please dont. this keyboard performs horribly in gaming, and i mean its terrible. this is a keybaord targeted at people who do a lot of typing across multiple devices and it is built with portability in mind. if i am ambitious enough i can probably stuff this keyboard into my pocket, because of how small it is. like my friends say i have small hands, well this keyboard was probably designed for a rat because my hands are huge compared to this keybaord. sometimes while i am resting my hand on the homerow my ring finger accidentally presses one of teh mushy media buttons at the top and everything i am doing goes into stasis. but that is more of a me problem than a problem with this keyboard. it does come with arrow keys which is very surprising. they actually managed to squeeze it in.i mean thats pretty much it for this keybaord. dont buy it for rs.3 k i suggest waiting for a discount because this thing is certainly not worth that much. i would say this is like a rs.1.4 k keyboard but thats just my opinion. if you are buying this for the android experience then i suggets buying it bunded with the mouse. because both of them kind of complete each other. with that being said im going to conclude my review.,mouse came turned on. apart from that no issues discovered till now, it going good.,its one of the best budget keyboards i have ever used.. the membrane keys are very soft and easy to click not lift off weight easy on the fingers its been around <number> yr since i bought this keyboard and iam using it ever since no issues so far and iam highly satisfied with my purchase definitely gonna recommend it . very good typing experience so far,httpsm.media-amazon.comimagesi61 liml3 ts4 l.sy88.jpg,consno caps lock indicatorheight isnt adjustableno backlight,the key travel is very very less, please keep that in mind. otherwise a decent product at the price range.,i bought this in combination with a logitech pebble m350 bluetooth mouse for the sole purpose of using it with my ipad. it has made my tasks easier and with recent ipados updates, there are tons of shortcuts that make ipad experience more productive. since i was going for a retro-looking device, i chose sand color. makes me nostalgic about the old school computer devices that had similar finish. connectivity is fast. you just switch it on and its connected to your primary device in a matter of seconds, even less. they keys are not silent but at the same time not loud enough to disturb your environment.you can connect upto <number> devices and switch between them seamlessly with the push of a button. im also using the setup for gaming. will maybe update later about that experience.final comments ergonomic, economic, portable and lovely! recommend buy for all who need to get work done fast.,this keyboard is awesome , it has a flawless connectivity and a great size for portability . just that it is not fitted with a lift at the back and i miss the backlight design , but it is a value for money product . works flawlessly with mac as well as windows.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41EIVJvXxsL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

c-in is selected as my requirement is not for pc or laptop further search is not done for ups with communication port and auto save software and in view of better interface power led dual color, charging led dual colour, battery saver led . it also has better backup and surge power than apc bx600 ci-in minus resettable thermal relaybased on the reviews, there are four major issues i have noticed,1 very old stock battery capacity expected to be in reduced condition, resulting into low backup time or battery issue.2 transit damages, as it is bulky to its volume. though it is better to purchase such items offline, i still tried online in view of remote location.3 no load protection . it acts if very low load is connected e.g. just modem or less than <number> w and battery saver mode is on after <number> min , people get confused it as giving only <number> min backup it shouldnt be considered as a problem once known, since additional loads can be connected or battery saver mode can be unselected4 if battery saver is enabled , it shutdowns while <number> min juice still left it shouldnt be considered as a problem, since it can be unselected if selected intentionally or unintentionallyto reduce the above risks, ms appario retail private ltd was chosen at lightening deal at rs rs2659.00. the order was placed on <number>.19. the product is delivered in <number> days on <number>.19. the original packing was wrapped in repeated turns of polyethylene. the packing reached without any major distortions. the original cartoon packing was in sealed condition. however when it was opened, some parts looseness sound was coming from the ups. the same was reported to apc service center. they registered the complaint and told me that the service person will visit within <number> hours of working days. further they have given clearance to put the ups in service.first it was charged fully , while ups in off condition charging light was on while charging and it became off after charging. now the ups was made on by power button it is to be pressed and hold for not less than <number> second before release or release after beep tone connected to pc with <number> inch led tv, initially some repeated chattering without any power interruption to the load was happening, if power input is kept off on battery. it was happening some times.when it is on battery, beep sound was occurring every <number> sec against apc manual spec of <number> sec.it withstood for <number> minutes for the pc with <number> inch led tv on battery. battery save mode was in off conditionfurther it got switched off within <number> sec of low battery alarm, against <number> sec specified in the manual.the manufacturing date as per slip glued on original packing was nov, <number> photo attached but the test and quality passing date is <number>.2018 <number> hrs photo attachedas my load is more than <number> w, i can put it on battery saver mode, the battery saver button to be pressed and hold for not lessthan <number> seconds before release to change the state , this is minor but the holding time is no where written in the manual.the ups body temperature appears to be on higher side, when compared to numeric installed at office under similar ambient temperature while on load with input mains as well as while in off condition without charging but connected to mains.the above is initial experience only, any updates shall be shared in future.note1 this item isnt eligible for returnfor safety reasons, items containing flammable liquids or gases cant be returned to amazon. for more information or help, please contact them.if you want return facility search for other alternativesupdate <number> the service person called me on <number>.19 and informed about his planned visit on <number>.19.the service person visited in the morning of <number>.2019 and disassembled the ups, there was a minor play with the battery, the whole casing is of plastic, one side cover opens including top as one part the play may be due to design manufacturing tolerances. the pcb and the transformer were already firmly fastened to body and all connections were also tight. hence the looseness is acceptable. the battery manufacturing date was oct <number>. i agreed for his optional proposal to replace with a new sealed battery but manufactured in sept <number>. the chattering may be relevant to building wiring, as it is not happening with main sockets in other rooms or if we remove ups input plug from the same socket see next update for accurate reason . in the whole, the service persons only concern was hotter transformer, based on his experience but it will be replaced only if it fails.prompt response of service center is appreciable that too for an interior of <number> km from service center, located at state capital and it compliments the non return policy.update <number> it is fully charged with replaced battery and backup time was tested with the same load as above. but this time large improvements were observed in the backup time and parameters difficult to reason out as below.backup time is <number> min until some different type of blinking of power led different type of beeps happens for few seconds, may be relevant to battery saver mode and however it got normalized in auto after <number> min further, the battery low blinking of power led occurred hence total <number> min against <number> min of earlier experience as above and these beeps occurred for <number> seconds before it tripped against <number> seconds of earlier experience as above, but power led was glowing for every few seconds till further <number> seconds in off condition.battery on beep was occurring for every <number> seconds <number> min to indicate the load is on battery against every <number> second earlier experience as above. i was totally involved with service person as it has to protect very costly, bulky and distant service partner type equipment at my home . he has replaced only battery, and he has not even removed the pcb. but how, so many wonders have happened is yet to be analyzed and reasoned out.note <number> i nonrms-multimeter does not properly read the voltage of a ups that uses stepped approximated output sine wave while on battery. hence output voltage of a <number> vac ups is measured to be between <number>-<number> vac when on battery.ii low voltage cut off will act if any separate low voltage , high voltage cutoff protection is used at outlet of ups while on batteryiii chattering may take place at ups if any separate surge protection is used at ups outletiv some body already advised not to use any surge protection at input to upsv apc service person informed that apc ups will not on, if house is not properly grounded earthing is to be proper to protect from surges.vi if ups is on battery with battery saver mode enabled i.e. mains off it will give only <number> min backup to loads less than <number> w as no load protection acts, however if the load is more than <number> w , it shutdowns while <number> min juice still left i.e. if we disable battery saver mode we will get <number> min more backup powerfrom the above , the ups is now functioning as per specifications. but one star of apc is reduced against initial issues of equipment, though super fast response exists from their service center , <number> stars to ms appario retail private ltd the seller, <number> stars to the apc service center and <number> stars to courier ms delivery for safe and fast delivery.update <number> after <number> months of use , backup time testing ignoring erroneous tests in betweenthe ups was made on and battery saver was made off , due to this the ups started self charging further and i have waited till the charging is completed. now, the tv as monitor with pc were made on it took upto <number> amp during cold boot , amp measured with clamp meter while mains is on. once the pc stabilised <number> a the mains is switched off. now it gavea backup of <number> minutes with beep every minute and given repeated beeps at <number> th min. again every min one beep started for <number> min. after this repeated beeps occurred for <number> second and ups got tripped. hence i got <number> minutes and <number> seconds in total. in view of this the star rating is retained at <number> star.one more observation is that its transformer temperature is high while it is on battery that means more energy is being wasted by transformer.i got the battery replaced one more time on <number>.2020 under warranty as backup time reduced to <number> min under the same conditions and load. with new battery i am getting <number> minutes. hence the apc is being letdown by battery manufacturer where apc quality person should have control. after warranty i will install battery from exide and see.,prosthe device is sleek, small and blends into the environment.consmakes a lot of noise.i bought this primarily to support my television sony xr-<number> x90 k to handle the switch from generators to mains for <number> secs. it is not sufficient to do that and the tv switches on and off continuously when running on ups power. im not sure what the problem is as the wattage is sufficient.if you have a similar use case as mine, better consult a local inverter shop and get a ups that fits your requirement. else, you will end up with dead weight.,easy to install,my pc has a <number> w psu with <number> bronze effeciency but installed components are not supposed to go beyond <number> watts under max load. this ups shuts down as soon as my gpu gtx <number> reaches <number>.then i used it for my printer. but as soon as i hit print, the ups shuts down. so its useless there as well.now its attached to my tv, router and speakers. atleast i can watch netflix uninterrupted.,im getting trouble in this i think this is not working properly where should i

was high,super head phone under <number> rs,wow nice this headphone just like fall in love ye kuchh jyada hi ho gya,good quality","-------------------------------------------------update20012018-------------------------------------------------its been <number> months since i first got boat rockerz <number>. some of the dislikes ive mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. i said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but im quite used to it and im loving it.. the second point is i said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but i was wrong. you might ask why... here is whyafter a long gap, i visited my father who is an audiophile. he has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately, he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. i said yes i regret it he paired it with his device and played a song. boy!! you got to see the grin on his face d. he said im keeping it you buy another one. poor me was forced to buy another one. a few days back i got another one one thing i noticed in two of my purchase isthe audio cable is no good. both my audio cable had the same issue.----------------------------------------------------------------------------so the moral of the story is hide it from your audiophile dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.jokes apart, people, you cant go wrong with this purchase. its worth every square inch.happy shopping...end of update---------------------------------------------------i got this product <number> days back, and i got it for rs. <number> lightning deal of course this is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the productthree days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry i cant help the excitement...----------------------------------------------------likes1 good built quality------- <number> it is sturdy, for the price the build quality is great. it is not flimsy. the ear cushions are good enough.-----------------------------------------------------<number> sound quality-----<number> if you are an audiophile this is not for you. bass is decent nothing to go overboard as noticed in other reviews. bass is deep enough for the price.--------------------------------------------------------<number> connectivity pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ <number>---------------------------------------------------------<number> dual mode- wired and wireless boat rockerz <number> comes with an aux cable.if you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. i couldnt find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though i absolutely loved this feature. -----<number>-----------------------------------------------------------battery backup im impressed with the battery backup of this beast. ive been using it for <number> days for <number>-<number> hrs a day still its running. so i guess the <number> hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick i presume its true. so far so good. will update it after a months usage.------------------------------------------------------------dislikes1 sound quality is more on the flatter side. when you compare it with budget wired headphones like sennheiser cx <number> street ii bass is not too deep. you wont get that ambiance. boats website saysdont just be loud, be loud and clear, nope... sorry ive to disappoint you on this. when its loud its not at all clear. a lot of distortions are there when you are loud.----------------------------------------------------------<number> comfort believe me, its not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. your ear will beg you to take it off after <number>-<number> mins.. if you have high fortitude you can push it till <number>-<number> hrs... if you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...----------------------------------------------------------<number> range boats says <number> meters range... in my experience, if you go beyond <number>-<number> meters then the voice will break. you will never ever get <number> mtrs range trust me on that. and im experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but i dont know whether it will be a problem down the line. will let you guys know about it later if its a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- <number> flimsy aux cable i cant complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. remember i paid only <number> for it. but with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. mi note <number> had issues, mi <number> also had issues with aux. not sure whether its the problem with my device. but it worked flawlessly on my laptop.-------------------------------------------------------------<number> wafer thin service centers boat gives <number> yr warranty but what good is it if you cant find any service centers near you. this is a hit or miss guys...--------------------------------------------------------------<number> voice cancellation i didnt find this effective. maybe its just me, not sure.---------------------------------------------------------------<number> microphone is pretty much useless. you cant make calls with this headset.-------------------------------------------------------------------some alternatives these are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, i compare it with them because boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you1 sennheiser cx <number> street ii i dont think boat can beat this ones quality. the sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of <number> this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. i own <number> of this beauty. total value for money. if you are an audiophile and are on a tight budget then i cant a better alternative than this.2 soundmagic e10 c in-ear headphones with mic blackgold this is another tvfm earphone3 sony extra bass mdr-xb250 on-ear headphones--------------------------------------------------------------------dont buy it1 if you are an audiophile obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones d <number> if you intend to use it for long hours.----------------------------------------------------------------------buy it1 if you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2 if you require a wired and wireless package in one..-----------------------------------------------------------------------verdict id give this headphone a score of <number> <number> if you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free bluetooth headphone with good performance then close your eyes and buy this beast trust me you wont regret it you wont be disappointed. in this price range, i couldnt find any other headphone with such a performance. we dont have many options.... do we p pthe actual price is rs. <number> and amazon claim they are giving <number> discount. pls dont fall for that. i would not recommend paying more than <number> rupees for this headphone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------note im not an expert in this field. this is just a lay mans review.thank you for reading the review and i hope this will help you with your purchase decision..,my boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and i wanted a new pair of headphones and i wanted them to be over the head types like this one. i also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since i would be using it for the tv, laptop and my phone. i have fumbled with this strata of the headphone market previously and after buying good for nothing ones from motorola, i chanced upon this.value for moneygood bassnice sound qualitygood build, but not premiumif you can get it below <number> rs, then it is a very good deal,its difficult to let go of my boat headphones , i bought this on <number> for a <number> k price on sale , the bluetooth was working fine but it went off after an year , i know this would happen , and thats when the legendary aux cable comes in , ive been using it with the aux cable for almost <number> years again , but later the top headphone band broke off , i used a fevistick to stick it up , and used it , i stretched it even further but it broke again , but there is no difference in soundquality what so ever so far , its been a soldi <number> years since usage of this product , still trying to stretch it further , if it doesnt work , i may hvae to say good by to this beast of a product , and its sad to note that the current boat products on offer fail to deliver this robust quality , theyve become the company that focuses on quantity over quality nowadays , evolutions aside , i gotta respect this product for what it has given me so far .,i genuinely reviewed after <number> years and its still working but once head strip was broke i fixed it by using youtube video overall its very good purchase for me.,dont think about specs you can blindly buy because it worth it,i recently purchased the boat rockerz <number> bluetooth headphones. they have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable. the battery life is also impressive, with up to <number> hours of playback. overall, im very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of bluetooth headphones.,under <number> rs it is best head phone.... sound quality super, bass good, noise cancelation not bad, product weight not heavy.,nice headphone, nhi,bole to jhakassound quality is very good and bass is also good but i was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that, hhh laalach karna buri chijh h, hum sudhrenge nhi kabhii think u r bored sum of this headphone mast hai enjoying,good quality, easily connected my

is based on testing done the same daysummarythe product is genuine and sturdy, but the performance is just about average, based on a random file copy performance to fill the entire space.pros cons comparing with sandisk cruiser blade <number> gb pros-<number>. solid body, looks and feels great.2. read speed is fine <number> mbs.3. product is genuine, covered under <number> year manufacturer warranty.cons <number>. fits too tight in usb port, thus causing more wear to the port and may even damage it if not used carefully.2. capacity is <number> gb precisely <number> bytes, not <number> as advertised. in windows itll show up as a <number> gb drive compared to <number> in sandisk. no big deal, just a technical observation.3. write speed <number> mbs is not bad, but slightly inferior to its close competitor sandisk cruiser blade which easily gives <number> to <number> mbs for the same test.4. warranty is only <number> years, compared to <number> years on sandisk. but since almost nobody claims warranty after <number> years, and besides- the plastic body of sandisk gets physically damaged in <number> years anyway, so its okay for me.bottomlineits good enough for casual users, maybe chosen over sandisk for its look, feel and sturdiness. frequent users may want to look for better options- with easier port fitting and better write speed.detailsthe product name is hp v236 w as shown on its packing the images in listing are correct while its part number is fd236 w-<number>, so slightly confusing but both are the same thing.testing whether it is genuine or fakethe bottom of the hologram sticker on the packing has a silver layer with scratch and check written on it. scratching it reveals a <number>-digit code beneath it, and the right edge of the sticker has the url to verify this code. go to support product authentication page on that url. that page contains instructions and explanation of the results that you may get. mine were originals, with the codes tested for the first time repeat test result will be a warning that the code was tested before.so that means it is covered under <number> year manufacturer warranty, as declared by hp for aisa pacific region.design and build quality sturdy, stylish but with a design flaw-it is exactly as shown in the picture. the body is a solid steel case with open front and the back sealed with a black plastic cap. the plastic back fits perfectly and gives it a stylish look, though it may come off later. the hp logo, product code etc are embossed on the steel body so likely wont be erased with time. overall, it looks and feels great. the flaw i noticed was that it takes significantly more strength to push it into the usb port, compared to other usb devices like generic usb cables or usual plastic pendrives like sandisk. you almost have to fight with it to push it in or pull it out. this means its frequent use can wear out the usb port too soon, or may even break it if not used carefully.capacity <number> gb, not <number>, will appear as <number> gb in windows-it is advertised as a <number> gb drive but the actual capacity is <number> gb, and yes, im fully aware of the decimal vs binary calculation difference, im a hardcore linux user. to be precise, its exact capacity is <number> bytes on both pendrives i tested. so in windows it will show up as a <number> gb drive. in linux it will show up as either <number> gb, or <number> gib binary calculation like windows. for comparison, my <number> gb sandisk shows up as <number> bytes, or <number> gb, or <number> gib. this loss of <number> gb in a <number> gb pendrive is no big deal for me, just a technical observation.performanceread speed about <number>-<number> mbswrite speed about <number> mbstested with a collection of iso files ranging from about <number> mb to <number> gb, along with a few smaller files like pdf or txt. total size of the collection was about <number> gb <number> gib.i did this testing on linux, so to be fair, the write performance may be slightly better on windows as it works better with fat32 that the pendrive comes formatted as.edit no performance difference on windows either. formatted as exfat on windows <number> to make it multiboot with yumi. read-write speeds were same while copying iso files to it, or reading them to load in memdisk while booting.i could do more accurate testing with tools like dd command but didnt bother as the difference usually isnt very significant.,ups.....the product is very good, i mistakenly washed it <number> n washing machine with my pants but it is still running like new. no data loss problem or data corrupt problems i have faced yet.downs......the only downside is this pendrive is little slow because of technology

can expect it to work for a year,good buy but <number> side earphone stopped after <number>-<number> months,vocals are good music is bit dizzy and there is a sound zzzzzzzzzz when everything is silent ..,superb","technical specifications---------------------------------heres the technical information of boat bassheads <number> in-ear headphones. the information provided below is as per the manufacturer. boat bassheads <number> have a frequency range of <number> hz to <number> khz. it features <number> mm drivers. rated impedance of <number> ohms. comes with <number> meter flat tangle free cable. <number> mm gold-plated l-shaped audio jack <number> degrees. sensitivity <number> db-<number> db.built quality design---------------------------------i was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise, boat bassheads <number> are fully made up of metal. it has a diagonal grid-like texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch. the metal construction gives boat bassheads <number> a premium feel attractive appearance. the cable used by boat on bassheads <number> is flat with rubberized coating, it is a tangle-free cable does its job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling. despite the metal construction, boat bassheads <number> are very lightweight comes with a microphone l-shaped <number> mm audio jack which is again made up of metal. overall the built quality is excellent for the price seems very durable. the ear buds have proper l r labels and are clearly visible. boat bassheads <number> comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed out-of-the-box.audio quality-------------------to ensure that i can test the bassheads <number> at their uppermost limit, i used high-quality mp3 files of <number> kbps lossless audio formats like flac wav. for smartphone listening, i used poweramp music player tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability. for the computer, i used itunes player vlc audio player. i also tested these earphones on apple ipod, iphone sony mp3 player. all this went for more than <number> days finally, i had my results.boat bassheads <number> promised what they claimed, they really are very bassy as compared to others. during my tests with them, i found that the audio quality is very good for the price, the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default, by tweaking the equalizer settings a bit, i saw a good level of improvement in the vocals, they were clearer than before but overall average. the treble was again very good, the high-frequency sounds were clear pleasant to ears. the mids were average but overall the audio experience on boat bassheads <number> was decent. when listening to music, the overall sound quality is amazing, you can easily distinguish between different instruments sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphones.noise isolation comfort-------------------------------------when it comes to noise isolation, boat bassheads <number> are very good at it, they come with medium sized ear tip pre-installed which seemed perfect for my ears, once the earphones are on, i wasnt able to hear outside noise, they sealed my ears completely delivered an immersive experience. make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation comfort. overall boat bassheads <number> are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff somewhat awkward when used for longer periods. since the housing is made up of metal, you may find them popping out every now then when used during running, jogging or any other sport or physical activity, this didnt happen as often for me but for a friend, they keep popping out every now then while running maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it, an easy solution to this will be using the ear hooks which came along with it. when using bassheads <number> with ear hooks, they were a bit uncomfortable initially, but as i got used to them, they were fine, plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on them.-----------------------------------------flat cable microphone-----------------------------------------the cable is great, i personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free comes with a rubberized coating. the cable does its job well. the microphone is again exceptionally good, it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise. during calls, the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance. there is one button on the microphone which helps to pick upreject calls on the go, without taking your phone out. it can also be used to control music, which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like boat bassheads <number>.warranty price---------------------------------boat bassheads <number> comes with standard one year warranty, so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe, in case you need it for warranty.final thoughts!----------------------ive personally used boat bassheads <number> in-ear headphones for more than two weeks average daily two hours of listening before writing this review and im pretty much impressed with them. im personally a fan of extra bass iems and currently, my primary iem is sony mdr-xb50 ap which again falls under extra bass category. comparing sony mdr-xb50 ap with boat bassheads <number> will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them, but i would still like to add that bassheads <number> did a great job and didnt disappoint me, obviously it doesnt stand a chance in front of sony mdr-xb50 ap but still looking at the price of bassheads <number> the quality they offer, i was really very impressed.boat bassheads <number> turned out to be exceptional earphones, after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices music players, i can say that theyre amazing for the price, a pure steal deal. the bass output is amazing and is very intense, ill recommend using correct size ear tips good quality music player like poweramp android for better bass output. the treble is good vocals are average, somewhere i feel that bass overpowers the vocals, but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results. the mids are again average.my rating <number> out of <number> the verdict---------------------------------taking everything into account, overall im very impressed with boat bassheads <number>. the built quality is amazing, the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass good overall soundstage. tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals, mids highs. overall the vocal highs are good mids are average but still good for the price. ill recommend these iems to bass lovers budget-conscious people who are looking for high quality durable earphones at a reasonable price. genres like edm, rock, hip-hop sound really great on them. boat bassheads <number> justify the price they come for, the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price range.hope i helped you.thanks,yes, so you have heard that this is the best wired earphone under <number>. yes you can consider it to buy. but there are few points to remember before buy. from my user experience i can tell you this-<number>. this is not comfortable at all. it slips from ear mostly. you feel pain in ear after using it.2. never buy this for online class, as it is not possible to wear it <number>-<number> hours straightly.3. after switching from boat basshead <number>, i feel that the bass is not good as the previous one. i dont know why. it should be better.4. sound dont explode or go outside of the buds to <number> as it go outside on boat <number> headphone, so its good.5. feeling heavier on ears. not as comfortable as realme buds <number>. though both are metal build. for balance sound you can buy realme buds <number>. buy it only to listen music, not for too long time. do not consider it for online class and long time wear session. hope it helped you. its just my opinion from using boat <number>, boat <number>, boat <number>, realme buds <number>, mi basic.,its a very good product but i dont recommend buying this because earpiece is heavy and you need to keep adjusting it and pushing it inside whenever you move your head, they will fall off easily with the slightest motion, you will soon find it annoying. sound quality, build quality everything is good but earphones falling off ears will irritate you.,raat me apne babu se dhere dherebaat krne pr v aacha se sunae deta h,i purchased the product a year ago.it worked fine.i love the sound quality.but you may not expect it to work after a

sandiskxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxbefore we proceed with the muscle-merits or the key features of the device, lets have a quick look upon my personal selection process.dual drive apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage, i chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over. i could have gone with a basic pendrive with a usb to otg adaptor cable but then i realized, in todays comfort-seeking world, whos will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it ,then fit it ,in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement.64 gb this capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage, price future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size.64 gb ensures that you wont have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basis.sandisk in the recent few years, sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization, quality and brand image offers the best value for money deals for an average usage.moreover, could not find much, reputed brands in the storage with otg feature.a note speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend, samsung.about our productxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx the device comes with the title sandisk ultra - dual drive m3.0 and is the newer <number> version of its previous iteration. here i need to quote that the term ultra came quite as a surprise to me as i found nothing in lines with a common understanding of ultra. we will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed. with a micro-usb connector on one end and a usb <number> connector on the other, the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones, tablets with micro usb ports only or laptops.both the connectors are carved out of metal the usb <number> connector is backward-compatible with usb <number> ports. size the size of the usb is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplaced.the usb fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and <number> inches when expanded at usb end. construction the device has a plastic body the overall construction of the drive is just average. the retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it. however the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and wont give up so easily. both the usb ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief. fit finish being equipped with a retractable mechanism being too small, the drive is not so smooth to use slide-in or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the otg drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving size.the usb ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy. storage format since the previous fat32 version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of <number> gb for a single file ntfs was not compatible with mac os so with increasing file sizes ex fat format was devised which doesnt have a size limitation like fat yet is compatible with mac as well. so our drive has only ex fat ntfs formats to choose comes in ex fat by default with <number> kb file allocation size. increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds a little but will affect the storage capacity little too. changing it from <number> to <number> kb increased my write speeds from <number> mbs to <number> mbs if thats a relief to anyone.the format would surely work well with most of the tvs, tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to ntfs if it doesnt work. speed the de-merit detail i have been a flagship gadgets freak all my life preliminary to my purchase i had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then i did not have speed in my mind as a primary motive for this there were not many options for dual otg device, so i took a leap of faith and went ahead with purchase.my basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my tv or mobile, however when i was transferring <number> movies of a total size <number> gb , it started showing <number> minutes which kept on getting higher it felt like waiting forever for it to happen.even for a single movie of <number> gb it took <number> minutes <number> sec by stopwatch to transfer. the write speeds started with <number> mbsec and went down down to <number>-<number> mbsec. even with my older kingston dt elite <number> <number> gb,the write speeds were in excess of <number> mbsec.i admit i have a usb <number> port at my laptop yet i was never used to such low speeds ever. the tagline ultra and mentioned speeds of <number> mbsec which i suppose is the rated max. speeds at usb <number> ports felt like a dream and beyond exaggeration.finally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying. even in ntfs format speeds were the same.i had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of <number>, thus finally i decided to return it but i suppose i will only get a replacement not reversal.i know that read-write speeds depend upon a lot of factors including transferred file type, format configuration of drive, configuration of host destination device etc.benchmark crystal disk mark scores for a file transfer of <number> mb size were <number> mbs -read <number> mbs write which looked like a mere consolation. transfer between my samsung s7 mobile s2 tablet too was not fast.verdict yes my friends , all other reviews about this being slow to the point of being unbearable are absolutely right and maybe san disk should retag it as ultra-slow. storage out of the total name plate rating of <number> gb , the actual allocated space for usage is around <number> gb which is ok enough. warranty the product comes with a <number> year limited warranty which is one of the segment best offers. price i bought the device for <number> bucks which was reasonable to me given the storage size, dual drive brand image. mrp over the pack was printed <number> bucks it was tagged made in malaysia. only if, it was a bit faster.final verdictxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxall in all, in my personal opinion given the brand image, ultra-tagline modern day technology advancements, even if you try to be too generous or lenient upon the transfer speeds yet its hard to spare such a low read write rates.even for routine tasks it will keep on reminding you of the compromise you made for a full price. it could have been a great all-rounder device coupled with the good brand reputation of sandisk <number> years of warranty, had its speed been any better.,covered here actual storage space, heating, mobile phones, tight fitting on mobile phones, speed, formatting file system, value for money, free app, company, brand, seller.about company, product seller1. sandisk ultra is a brand of western digital which is the same company that sells external hard-disk storage devices under the brand wd elements and wd portable.2. about <number> to <number> years ago, wd elements portable drives of <number> tb and <number> tb were priced rs. <number> less than current day prices. they were sold by cloudtail seller on amazon.3. now sandisk and wd drives are sold by appario retail seller on amazon.4. for best prices on sandisk and wd products in india, the current seller has the lowest prices for authentic brand new products.5. reason for higher prices for same brands same capacity storage devices may be various - such as import duties, taxes, manufacturing costs, higher demand for the brand, etc.review sandisk ultra dual <number> gb usb <number> otg pen drive gold1. storage space just as in external hard-disk drives, the actual usable storage space will be less than what is mentioned on the product.2. same as others for the <number> gb pen drive, actual storage space available is <number> gb. this is normal and not some fraud or fake advertisement. this is because it has fat32 file system. also, the device uses some space for its functionality and use.- in linux os laptop the available storage space on this fat32 pen drive is shown to be <number> gb. so thats <number> gb more than what windows os calculates using their ntfs file system.3. heating even with just <number> minutes of use, you can touch and feel that the metal part of the pen drive is getting heated. but the performance of the drive has not got affected by the heat. this heating does not happen in wd external hard-disks and seems to be unique to small pen drives of various brands.4. mobile phones the pen drive works with android os of mi phones such as redmi note running android including old android version <number> as well.5. too tight for phones the pen drive is a tight fit on mobile phones tablets - so be careful when pulling it out so as to not damage your phone - because this is also the charging point for your phone. if you feel that your phone is too tight for this pen drive, then it is best not to use it for phone data storage management.6. value for money even if you dont use this pen drive for mobile phone - it is still the best price for a <number> gb pen drive with a usb <number> backward compatible with older usb ports on older laptops and computers.7. speed the speed is extremely good for windows os laptop, linux os laptop and android mobile phones.8. file system formatting the pen drive unless you are sure you wont use your pen drive on a particular device, dont format the pen drive to change its fat32 file system.but for example, if you have decided that you wont use it on mobile phones or tablets because the fitting is too tight and you dont want to risk damage to this point which is primarily used for charging - then go ahead and format the pen drive for your laptop.- with ntfs formatting you will see an increase in available storage space in your pen drive.- with your linux systems file format, you will have better storage space than any windows file system.- beware that if the pen drive has ntfs file system then it wont work with mobile phones, tablets, laptops which dont have windows operating system. same way, if you format the pen drive for linux os file system, it wont be recognised on windows laptops, android phones, tablets, etc.- if like most people you will be using this pen drive on laptops or other devices of friends or co-workers, then leave the existing fat32 file system as it is.9. free app memory zone app for android is bundled free in this pen drive. it is easy to install and doesnt take any phone permissions other than storage access. it is very useful app with easy user-interface. app takes <number> mb storage space on android phones.- features include cleaning junk files that you may not otherwise know through your phones file manager app. enable or disable automatic backup to your pen drive. add cloud storage such as google drive or microsoft one drive and add microsd card storage to manage all your files from just one memory zone app. restore backup. copy, move, delete, files as well as clean up whatsapp related files. see available storage space on your phone. see data sorted into photos, videos, music, documents.10. beware - users of memory zone app should know that they agree to terms of use which include that if some government agency requests the company for information against piracy - such as illegal copy, storage, distribution of movies, music, software, books, etc as per dmca copyright laws then the company will provide the users data to the government investigating agency to protect the intellectual property of content owners.overall - best product in the market, at best price in indian market, with features not offered by other companies for similar specs.,value for money. may be desig can be improve for the sliding and handling,it was good with compatibility and storage of data but its slow in data transfer. it take so much time for moving and copying of files,good quality,good quality product,pendrive quality to aacchi h par , storage <number> gb ki jagah <number> gb hi milta h

goods.here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand already exist in the market- but at lower prices. simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.if something isnt an immediate hit, amazon pulls it and moves on.amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product but with amazonbasics - amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.as an additional benefit, amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined immediately taken care of.about our product requirement vs actualxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxi recently purchased a new qualcomm <number> qbix car charger was looking for a cable with usb a to micro b connector. i listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements1. data exchangesince it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, data exchange capability was not much of my concern. preference though would surely have been a usb <number> but it didnt bother me if i could only get a usb <number> too.actual product i did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and i found it to be pretty well. i did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. the more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2. length of the cable again since i could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, i preferred to keep it short simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.actual product the cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely <number> meters or approximately <number> feet long. the length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passengers seat.3. tangle free flexibility strength standardsi am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. i wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.actual product the cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness a sturdy intermediate cable. the whole construction of the cable due its cable size flexibility is almost tangle-free.the associated cable was not exactly thick but cant be termed as thin or delicate too. its not the thickest ive seen but then thickest doesnt always means most durable. given my application its more than just suitable.the overall built quality of the cable insulation looks promising enough to last few years. even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.i had further shortlisted mansaa an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4. compact moulded connectorshad an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal pcbs.actual product there are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. the connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. the connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.the connector ports are sturdy enough both at usb a micro b ports. the micro b port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.no signs of loose construction.being gold-plated is more of a misleading fancy termin this case as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5. availability of tiesvelcro straps as per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, i expected an included cable tie or a velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust arrange the cable as per requirement.actual product this i miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which i could adjust my required cable length easily.6. decent current handling capabilityon the newest qc <number> certified chargers the current transmission can go up to <number> amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.actual product the actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to <number> amps against demands at new qc <number> chargers that could go up to <number> amps. here, let me clear out that the latest qc chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging thus it is not like a continuous flow of <number> amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above <number> amps would sufficiently work with qc <number> chargers.have tried it safely multiple times charging my samsung s7 from <number> without the cable getting hot.7. warrantycomes with a <number> year warranty as expected. not the best in the industry but reasonable.other observationsapart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are8. the cable is manufactured in china imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name philosophy of amazonbasics.9. the cable has a manufacturing date of oct <number> it was imported to india in dec <number>. the cable has a mrp tag of <number> bucks however i purchased it online for <number> bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11. a customer care toll free number email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.final verdictxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxit has been few days since i have received been using this product. so far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around <number> i suppose, its worth it.will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,worth for buy!,the quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in r and d, without r and d make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.as an past customer of many cables from amazon this cable doesnt also disappoint,supports fast charging for all my samsung phones.i use samsung a9 pro <number>, samsung s8 plus <number>, which this cable is compatible with .very sturdy, thick and very long. <number> ftvery affordable pricing. thanks amazoni also use a usb c cable for my samsung s20 fe.,super,product charging is ok.. however its mere <number> foot in length.. the vendor could have mentioned correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as i have received it today.,good,i have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in rs <number> and rs <number> of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.finall i decided to go for this.and it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchasemy advice dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.you will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.better buy this one.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31iESA2h2gL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

but with a couple of drawbacks.,simple and effective,a,on the heavier side but satisfied with the product,good quality, heavy noise,great product!,awesome cleaning machine","once you start using a bagless vacuum cleaner, you will never turn back using it on a weekly basis since nov <number>, so its a long tern review. coming from another vacuum cleaner that had bags, this one is truly a hassle-free cleaner, at least you are away from the hassle of maintainingcleaningreplacing bags which is truly a mess, and you would understand only if you have used cleaners with bags. further, devices with bags tend to get chocked now and then, leading to less suction. inside box1. vacuum cleaner unit2. flexible pipe with integrated retraceable brush and suction adjustment knob3. turbo brush nozzle4. multi-clean nozzle5. high suction flat inlet nozzle6. telescopic extension pipe7. user manual8. warranty cardthe power cord is <number> mtr and device comes with a mechanish to retrace it back into the machine. it has normal <number> amp <number> pin top which can easily fit in <number> or <number>-pin sockets both <number> amp or <number> amp, but better to connect it to <number> amp ones only considering its power consumption. observations pros1. device has high suction power and can be cleaned easily with a bagless design where dust collects in a chamber, and you can empty it in the dustbinno hassles of cleaning and replacing bags.2. components are high quality, such as the telescopic extension is metallic, though its also a con for this attachment. even plastic components are of good quality.3. device easily moves around owing to its big and smooth wheels. you dont need to pull it by force.4. default flexible pipe itself is long and has an integrated brush that can also be retracted. its a highly useful attachment considering its attached to a primary flexible pipe and is easily available for use.5. each attachment here is multipurpose. when you open the package, you feel like very few attachments are provided, but when you start exploring, you discover that all attachments are multipurpose. details below6. attachments are easy snap fit and remove activelock in the companys terminology. once you insert the attachments, it click locks and can be removed by a press of a button or release lever.7. both the turbo brush and multi-nozzle have flexible neck and wheels on the bottom for easy movement and effective cleaning8. dust collector can be opened with one press and has removable filters attached to it. these filters can be washed once in a while to prevent clogging.9. the main unit has h13 filter system to filter fine dust, dust mites, etc., and is equivalent to hepa <number>, as per the company. this filter is accessible from the backside for cleaning purposes.10. device obviously makes sound but is not in the range of causing irritation to the ears. its in the bearable range. observations cons1. telescopic extension is metallic and heavy. so, its a bit of trouble to use for longer durations, especially when you are trying to clean ceilings.2. reduction of suction power is via a bypass valve built into the flexible pipe and has no way to reduce the power of the machine to reduce suction. so effectively, this valve makes cleaner suck in air from in between to reduce suction at the end, but then consumes the same amount of power. if there had been a control mechanism to reduce power, it would also save electricity.3. device comes with a <number> amp top but its <number>-pin, so if you are going to use it with modular power sockets with self closing mechanism for holes, it will be a trouble to plug it in everytime.4. i miss the blower system in this cleaner, which is handy at times was there in my previous cleaner. they could have easily implemented it.for the cons reducing <number> star, but its definitely a <number>-star device. attachments- flexbile pipe comes with an integrated brush, and you can easily retract it back onto the pipe- multipurpose nozzle has a button to increase its suction power, and with one press, it goes nearer to the floor- turbo brush nozzle sweeps the floor or mattress with rotating bristles along the length, and if you want to turn off the rotation of the brush, there is a button to lock it- main unit has a system on the back and botton side to attach the multi-clean and turbo brush nozzle primarily for easy sweep or for storage purposes final verdictthis bagless vacuum cleaner is a hassle-free device and requires very less maintenance but it comes at a cost, and if you are willing to stretch your budget, its definitely worth it. i have had no any issues so far in the past <number> year, when using it regularly.,this is a nice bag less vaccum cleaner with a rotating brush that does a great job of cleaning. it also comes with good set of accessories. i found it also cheaper to order it online compared to the croma store. two drawbacks not a deal breaker i found and i hope philips addresses them were,1. it comes with a two pin <number> ampere plug and you need to buy an adapter to use with normal <number> ampere plugs in the house. i was afraid to use the adapter thinking that it may heat with the use but had no issues with heating of the adapter or the plugs in the wall during <number>-<number> minutes of cleaning each room in the house. i do not see a point in having that plug.2. during the use one just pulls it along but it has no handle to lift the machine. i believe that one can use the handle of the dust canister to lift the machine but i am afraid that repeated lifting like this will break the click-on mechanism so ended up lifting the machine as a whole all the time while moving the machine without the hose.as i mentioned earlier these are not deal breaker but enough to take one star off and can have the star back if philips addresses the issues on this great little machine.,suction power is good suitable for cleaning carpet , window curtains ,floors and carpets.cleaning the dust container is also very easy. only concern i have is, if some length power cord is not pulled out from machine, the power wire that still reamins inside the machine is getting heat from suction motor, after using the machine for nearly <number> hour and i pulled out the cord that was in the machine, it was actually liitle hot to touch not sure is it safe for the live power cord to warm up like this. would have been even better, if this had blower functionality also.,good product,cord length and suction power is satisfactory,good quality, heavy noise,this is the first vacuum cleaner purchase for me and i can say that i am a happy customer. i bought this back in august <number> and it is serving me well. it comes with attachments that are convenient and reach high places, it has three modes of cleaning tiled floors, carpets and sofas and with pets in the house it has made my life that much easier. thank you phillips for a good product and thank you amazon for a smooth transaction.,well-built, top-notch quality, suction power is too high.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xQDop2T5L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

i am mentioning, it as this scenario have happened with me once, hence i am very cautious about batteries now use it with smartphones or digital recorders.4. i think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less, considering the sound quality.best setting using audacity software these are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use audacity software, which is free !<number>. open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic.2. select entire audio clip and open effects and then distortion <number>. start the playback of audio clip in the software, so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to make.4.now select distortion type option on the top of box and select soft clipping . or select hard limiter and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you.5. take the clipping level cursor to extreme right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output.6. adjust the make-up gain cursor little bit if needed, i keep it on <number>. here you can select which ever type, which you feel is suitable for you.7. now just click apply <number>. now is noise reduction. for that select short section of audio which does not have your voice, but only has background noises that you dont want.9. open effects and then noise reduction <number>. click on get noise profile.11. now select entire audio clip and again open effects and then noise reduction <number>. finally, click on ok and thats it !now you are good to go with soft, slightly lesser noises and more pleasant sound output. after these steps, you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user software.verdict -----------i personally am very disappointed with the sound quality, though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level, but its satisfactory enough. plus price seems slightly more on this. i wouldnt recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment. buy this only if you live in very silent conditions.,its not great or best out there for beginners but good-i use a budget mid-range phone and the boya mic is better than in built mic of phone. record it in wav format, its good.-you gotta use softwareapps to pull the best of this, like audacity or some other editing app.-its pretty long and thats good as you can extend the cable to a good distance say if u r connecting it to the camera on a tripod.-overall its decent for beginners. i see high-end phones have good recording capabilities, but if you have a budget phone, then this one is deal.,microphone looks very well built, it supports both phones and cameras. there are some phones that does not support external mic, please check before buying as one of my phone did not support it.they claim noise cancellation, however, i did not notice major difference it also captures great amount of noise, only cancellation is because of foam padding around the microphone. i could not observe noise cancellation, at least, while recording on phone.overall package is well bundled, wire quality is decent, however the dongle quality is excellent, even the small clip to hold the microphone feels solid.,wire is to long but good if quality of wire is improve in future then <number> stars from me but now <number> star good sound low price <number> star - for wire quality but over all a nice product.,i think its good for online teaching like i do...but yeah some problems like very long cable length i mean someone might need but it should be optional.... or detachable price of the mic itself is not much anywaysi am okay with this mic for sometime... until i am sure i need quality rode mic to upgrade...,dont expect noice cancellation under this budget but audio recording quality is very good.,nice product,decent",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UYenF+lnL._SX300_SY300_.jpg

product,ear phone with jack,nice,good,good sound quality,value for money!","recieved damaged product the first time, the seller is very good and quickly replaced it for a new one. go for bassheads <number> if you are spending this much. they are charging more for the metal enclosure and the braided cable. the angled jack is a plus but the sound quality is so-so. infinity zip <number> and their own bassheads <number> are way better for sound.,i would like to start by saying im not an audiophile, therefore my review will be less about the audio quality of the product and more about the over all experience regarding the product. first off, this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it, its good enough that i will buy it a third time if need be!upon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of <number> pair of extra ear buds . there is also a pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds, these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is a chance of lots of movement. more on this later.coming to the ear phones itself, its among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand. it is very durable, specially the plug part that connects to your phone, many a time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones. this is not the case with these.the wire itself is made of rubbersilicon. it feels good in hand and the only thing i can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasnt showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires. another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out, this genuinely decreases the number of instances where i find myself trying to untangle the wire. this is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphones.remember i said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter. both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin. i dont know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face. it is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume, personally this problem didnt affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breaker.mic quality is subject to individual bias therefore i can tell you my personal experience. in my opinion i feel that the quality is average, it wont blow anyones mind but it will deliver most of the time. a common complaint i heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic, these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boat bassheads <number> finally the most important part of the review, the sound quality of the ear phones. as i said earlier i wont be going into the technical details . i am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place. in my opinion i found that the bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the extra bass versions of the sony line up of earphones trend to be. the volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not i use it at less than half its total volume when listening to music. the clarity of the boat bassheads <number> are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the <number> inr price category this is one other reason why i love this pair so much. a point to remember, as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones. this becomes a double edged sword, on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic. this causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used. the find unlike the ones find in lets say the newer bose ear phones arent as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged time.last but not the least, there are multiple color variants of the boat bassheads <number> including red, black and blue. i found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but i find it to be the best of the three. that said i do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color. this leaves out the red, for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales, therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they last.pros1 no metal build2 excellent wire quality and trendy3 durable4 above average sound qualitycons1 metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily2 supplied fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time3 supplied clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyi hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the bassheads <number>. all suggestions are welcome.thanking you, dwarakesh,best quality i like boat earphone saund quality,only disadvantage i noticed was this cant be use in usb phones, <number> mm jack is provided so it can be usedin jack phones only .,nice,good,i used this headphone for travel. very lite and easy to carry in pocket. colourful. sound

in these earphones are amazing.the mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but its that not punchy.but dont you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.the call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .these earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond <number>,alright. so i have been using boult probass curve for over a month and would like to summarize my feedback in bullet-points to make it easy for the prospective buyers. i was thinking to buy a quality bluetooth headset with a great performance at an affordable price for quite long and this is where my search ended. i was quite fed up of using cheap wired headsets as they used to go out of function or get snapped every now and then. moreover, i found them getting entangled every other second making it really inconvenient to handle especially while travelling. its that time i started feeling the need of a wireless headset and began my search. i took good time months to look for a good product. and, this is when i decided to purchase this item. before purchase i devoted time to read the users reviews that i always do before making any purchase-small or big and found myself convinced. finally, i decided to go for it. ok. so, no more essay writing let me get straight to the key points1. i bought this for <number> under sale so saved inr <number>. its a good saving. as warrent buffet says every penny saved is every penny earned2. this has great sound quality. i could not compare it against any other product because i dont have any other bluetooth headset with me but this will surely not let you down. it is very loud even at <number> volume level. you just cannot listen to at that level forget about full volume. bass is great but not outstanding to be honest but it does not disappoint either. good thing is the sound does not distort even if you raise it to <number>. excellent sound clarity!<number>. i am not a technocrat so cannot tell what are the characteristics of noise cancellation feature but you will not get to hear any external soundnoise or very very minimal that is not noticeable. so, this stands perfect at this point.4. performs excellent while taking a call. you will a get a crystal clear voice when you maketake a call using this device. you will feel as if you are making calls directly from the mobile phone. in fact, its even better at times when the voice from the other side is low. i really love the hands-free calling because i have to take long calls with the clients in my job.5. battery backup is excellent!!! it can last anywhere from <number> to <number> hours. i have tested it rigorously in both audio and video usage. and, i mean it. i tested it for almost a month with day-wise log capture. please see the detailed tracking at the end. it gets full charged in <number> hours approx.6. bluetooth range is good. it covers a distance of <number> to <number> feet easily. its quite enough if not good enough. my figures may be wrong. beware! its just my rough estimate. havent tested is rigorously.7. design looks good and is very convenient to wear. the wires are adjustable as per need. this is a nice thing. looks cool when you wear it around your neck. i chose red color.8. last but not the least. it comes with <number> year replacement warranty so you can sleep peacefully while enjoying your favorite music judgement just go for it if you have a limited budget or dont want to spend a fortune on bluetooth headset. i was hesitant to spend anything beyond <number> bucks on a bluetooth headset. it was my personal limitation.ps battery backup log16 may <number> hour <number> minutes approx in the

no major suppression or enhancementi checked the others as i usually hear music on a semi-pro system, and the insufficent bass lower-mids bothered me.nakamichi used to be a japanese company making very high end tape decks in the <number> s so the benchmarks were high now it is a china based company. the <number> w raised expectations further. as said, it is barely louder than the <number> w stone <number>. it is fairly even sound, but not a significant enough improvement in bass over the <number>. if you dont care about the money, and want something better, than the <number> with even sound, this could be it. the mids and terble, are a tiny bit better in the <number>. speck also has a larger battery, giving substantially longer backup, and better water protection useful if you use yours in the smallest room of the house the stone <number> is miles ahead in bass and loudness. if that is what you care for, amongst the <number> - your choice is simple. the bass is uneven, however. all three speakers have memberanes in the inner shell acting as passive bass radiators. one should not expect much nuance in bass from those. if a thump is what you care for - yes it is certainly there for the size. with somewhat uncontrolled bass, the midrange is compromised - somewhat suppressed and somewhat muffled. no, it is not major, and many mgiht not even really notice it much. the transiton between mid and lower-midsbass isnt great. one usually doesnt expect as much from such speakers, but the boat stone <number> set the bar high - very high.keep the boat stone at an angle such that the drivers speaker are in the direction of your ears. it makes the midrange a bit better. reduces the bass a bit, but makes the sound more even. tough it is impractical to keep it so, it makes the sound a lot closer to what i desire.some extrasplacement of these speakers makes a big difference. keep them about <number> away from a wall ideally a corner for enhanced bass and fuller sound.if you look at teardown videos, youll notice that the <number> has much bigger magnets than the others. it is a heavy speaker. i like that, since it keeps it stable and the rubber on the side helps further. it is well designed, except the and - volume buttons should have been interchanged for intuitive use.the <number> can also be placed vertically. that too changes the sound. lesser bass, and possibly a bit clearer on the whole reduced bass less intrusion into the mids, in such speakersspeaker characterics change subtly over <number> odd hours of use. often quite prominent in the first hour, so do not form an opnion before running them in for about an hour.conclusionnakamichi speck more even sound than the other two, not at all as loud as expected, better waterprof rating, bigger battery, high priced, despite chinese - buy if you dont care for the money, volume and are okay wihtout much bass.boat stone <number> it is a star! excellent even sound, however the lack of bass as compared to the others pulls it back. if you are on a budget, or if you dont care much for bass especially for lecturesdocumentaries or vocal music this is brilliant. i have used it for long.boat <number> heavy. loud. lots of bass. if you can deal with the somewhat and it is not big unevenness and slightly muffled sound -

and was mostly consistent.however it suddenly developed some snag and stopped connecting to the internet. apparently the ethernet port got damaged somehow. i tried calling tp link service center numbers and realised how bad their service is. its the first time in my life that a router has broken and that too after just over a years usage. and to make it worse theres dismal after sales service.i tried to buy a replacement from tp link but that router came with problems as the connection wasnt stable. i think ill finally look towards other router makers and avoid tplink product until maybe they start caring more for their costumers. hopefully ill find a good maker .,good router,after researching lot i settled on tp link a6,i was looking for better range router, this router really worth the price. dual band, guest wifi. i upgraded from tenda n301, and performance is really good.range for <number> gz is not that good as <number> gz but which is accepted and no other routers in this range can provide better than this.,i was using tenda ac <number> router since <number> for <number> mbps connection from local isp mach1 broadband, mumbai. most of devices <number> mobiles, <number> laptops, <number> firestick at my home work on <number> ghz except <number> cctv camera. range of tenda ac <number> was good and used digisol ac750 repeater for farthest room of my <number> bhk home.in recent lightning strike in mumbai, power adapter of tenda ac10 got burned out and performance issues creeped in with replacement adapter. i was searching for router with good range and speed within my budget. i tried <number> routers mercusys ac1900 mr50 g tp archer c80 ac1900 before this. both routers didnt meet my expectation. range and speed of these <number> routers were poor than my earlier tenda ac10. amazon accepted returns without a single question. thumbs up to amazon.after some more research, i zeroed on tp link archer a6 c6. as per comparison on tp link website both are identical routers. after doing some more research on blogs and reviews, i found that archer a6 is the latest model and had slightly better processor both from qualcomm. hence purchased archer a6. feature of onemesh is added advantage for adding onemesh repeaters in future. separate wifi ssid with same strength on both <number> <number> ghz as unnamed wifi can be seen on wifi analyser, as per tp link support page, this is dedicated wifi link for onemesh repeaters.now for router, router is same as tenda ac10 for coverage, it can not cover farthest room in <number> bhk on <number> ghz. <number> ghz band can cover <number> bhk house, but speed is around <number> mbps on <number> mbps plan. however, speed on archer a6 is better that tenda ac10. im getting <number> mbps upload and download consistently on devices <number> feet apart in <number> ghz. tp link archer a6 is better than costlier ac1900 routers. just for info, i received us version v2 of router instead of eu version mentioned on tp link india website. hence, firmware on tp link india website will not match with device firmware. however, this device has auto update option directly from internet. also, router can be managed by tp-link tether app remotely on internet even tough not connected on same wifi by login using tp link account on both router and tether app.by trying so many routers, i understood that <number> ghz range will be week even with costliest router. instead of using digisol ac750 repeater, i installed my old tenda ac10 in repeater mode for <number> ghz <number> ghz disabled. now my complete home is covered by <number> ghz signal. in the farthest room i receive download upload speed of around <number> mbps.i also tried old tp link archer c50 which i had purchased when abroad, performance is not good in terms of speed and range as it lacks gigabit ports, beam-forming mu-mimo.my isp has connected my link on gigabit port of their switch in my society. however, cabling is only <number> pair cat <number> e which supports max <number> mbps full duplex. i will try to get cabling changed to either <number> pair cat <number> e or cat6 from isp and check the performance. i will update review after cabling change.so in the nutshell i would recommend to go for router with gigabit ports, beam-forming mu-mimo even if your internet speed is less than <number> mbps as it is future proof. tp lnk archer a6 is good router meeting all requirement within the budget.hope this review is useful in search of good future-proof router.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------edit <number> my isp tried to replace my connection to ftth and this router was connected to fiber onu using gigabit port. it worked only for <number> mins. max speed was <number> mbps. isp was not able to resolve the ftth issue and changed cable to <number> pair cat-<number> e, which supports gigabit transmission. now net speed is around <number> mbps. my internet plan is <number> mbps. im happy with the speed. i have asked isp to change my connection to ftth at last. tenda ac10 is now working as wired repeater connected on gigabit port of archer a6 using cat5 e cable. now complete home received stable wifi of <number> mbps on <number> ghz band.i will update once again when ftth connection is successful.,good product till now <number> month,i am very satisfied.,i am really satisfied with this product as earlier my phone is keep getting wifi

where my vpn is not reconnecting even internet goes down and if any flatuations in the network as well.. finally i am not seeing any issue with this router.. it is helping me during work from home

highlight of amoled. in case you were using ips fhd panel on your previous phone you will have trouble distinguishing. i have samsung m51 as secondary device and i see black similar on both.9. bgmi - i played few rounds yesterday and did not face any frame drop or lag.10. two year warranty - they calaimed to provide two year warranty on this device but during registration it shows only <number> year. i have personally wrote to iqoo team and amazon team seeking an answer, with screenshots waiting for answer.btw majority of phone manufacturers provide <number> year warranty only, even iphone. here i would say fight for you justice and seek answer from iqoo or amazon team.11. video call lag - did not face any, did multiple video calls yesterday with different people, did not get any complaint from them about my video lag. for all of them my video popped up instantaneous.overall i would say i had a great buy and can recommend this device to others , for all the folks bombarding negative reviews, i would say first set your expectations right and you will be satisfied. in case even still you are facing problem then you have every right to complaint and get justice.overall i give this device a <number> star as of now since i am yet to test this device long term like <number> months or <number> months.please excuse any typos or grammatical errors if any. entire review was typed on my phone iqoo neo <number>.,i have been using a budget phone realme <number> since <number> dynamic black, <number> gb64 gb. it served me well, but it was time for an upgrade. i was looking for a midrange model this time that would have almost everything i wanted within my budget. did i get one lets dig into it!the good price. after discounts, i got a phone with practically all the features i wanted. iqoo is basically from vivo, an internationally recognized brand. hopefully, i dont have to worry about software updates for at least <number> years. iqoo is already doing good as i have received <number> security updates so far for the android <number> that came out of the box. i will keep an eye on the security updates and os upgrades as it will make me decide whether to go for vivoiqoo for my next phone. dual <number> g sim support, which is futuristic. with <number> g, the call quality has been superb so far. e4 amoled <number> hz <number> nits peak <number> x2400 pixels display with <number> contrast ratio, <number> hz touch sampling rate and hdr10 netflix hdr supported. a huge upgrade from my previous phone. the photos, ott movies look too good. easier to read contents like messages, emails or documents. <number> mp main cam with ois. ois was a must-have feature for me since i could be taking a lot of low-light photos. <number> mah battery with <number> w flashcharge technology <number> in <number> min, <number> in <number> min. works as claimed. the battery life has been satisfactory. sd <number> cpu. not one of the flagship processors today, but highly capable, and fantastic at this price. inclusion of <number> gb ram has made this phone a buttery-smooth one for running apps android is quite a ram dependent os unlike ios. up to <number> gb of phone storage can be used for extended ram. currently, i have <number> apps installed mostly productivity apps, but no gaming apps. the cascade cooling system seems to be working. <number> gb rom with ufs <number>. since phones nowadays tend to ditch a dedicated microsdxc slot, and this phone is no exception, i did not want the <number> gb variant. a fast, large internal rom is better than an external card as the latter loads the apps, files slower. the in-display fingerprint reader works well. the stereo speakers are reasonably good. infrared port ir blaster. i have not tried using it as a remote, but a must try. usb-c port with usb-c to usb-a data cable that connects to the phone charger. some of us prefer a usb-c to usb-c data cable instead as it is more friendly to the modern devices, but i can see why iqoo decided to provide a usb-c to usb-a. most laptops still come with usb-a ports even my recent hp <number> g8 laptop from the company i work for does have a usb-c port without power delivery, and two usb-a ports!. my powerbanks dont have usb-c ports either. screenshots, lock screen virtual buttons. must as using physical buttons frequently for these functions can potentially damage the buttons.the bad google backup. a fail. since i did not have a usb-c to usb-c cable, i had to choose the wi-fi data transfer option from my old phone to this one. although i selected all the files, google failed to transfer many files especially the pdfs. dear google, this is unacceptable. spam handling. my realme <number> lets me block any sms i want, but this one does not. in my opinion, every modern phone must have a native app that can identify the caller and help block a number or an sms as needed. i have stopped using a <number> rd party app like truecaller, which has become a truly rogue app. no <number> mm jack a plus when you dont have a bluetooth earphone, or dont prefer one, but iqoo thankfully included a usb-c to <number> mm adapter in the box. the absence of gorilla glass protection is not a good thing, but i do not mind as i barely drop my phone, and the phone came with an already applied tempered glass screen protector, and a transparent back cover. really appreciated. the plastic body does not bother me moreover, the dark nova color feels cool. ymmv. in my realme <number> and not in my realme c2, which means it is a custom feature from realme for specific os versions, if i try turning off the daily wakeup alarm, it gives me options like turn off on the next day for which the alarm is active, do not repeat any more, or cancel. this is a fabulous feature as it allows me to turn off the alarm for a particular day say, an upcoming leave or holiday without turning it off for the following days! unfortunately, this artificial intelligence is not available in my iqoo neo <number> <number> g.always buy a recently released model if you are going for an android phone. this will make sure that you get software support for long enough time. moreover, avoid buying the variant with lowest ramrom. and, fast charging is a necessity as you see that you are hooked up with your phone all the time.i have used this phone for <number> months and will update this review as i keep using it. till date, i am quite satisfied with iqoo neo <number> <number> g i also liked the funtouch os, and recommend it to anybody who has needs like me.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DLLa8HNWL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

continous usagei came from oneplus <number> t that too because last to last week i had an accident and my <number> t has dead on the spot.after watching a lot of reviews on youtube and amazon, i thought i should give it a chance.first impression- as you all know op <number> t has small display so its hard for first <number>-<number> days to usetyping because of big display. a little heavy but that could be because of upgraded species and battery from my last <number> t. solid built but it if its metal build then it will be more beautiful. space fusion color is looking killer. flash charger works awsome but charger design can be improved display is crisp and clear but but in dark apps i.e, chrome, brave, linkdin etc youll notice a color change from black to greyish color that gives a cheap feel and i dont know if its a software or hardware issue.actual review- while gaming call of dutymobile has some lags and bugs and there is no option to block notificationcalls even after mute notification onn everything is coming on screen and its very frustrating and annoying. battlefield mobile ground, asphalt <number>, clash of clans, battle royale are working flowless. some apps like flipkart and airtel gives some error screen zoom automatically while opening might be because of android <number> or something else. now this is very weird that this phone reset a few setting automatically themselves when i dont want that. i dont want to set them everyday before using my phone i.e, i am using bouncer to remove app permission when not in use and this phone remove accessibility setting even after batter optimization and background run.while listing to music i want paranomic <number> sound but it reset to default automatically. gesture are not working fine, this can be fixed with future updates. i admit that funtouch os has some more customization then oxygen os but it is missing some basic customization feature like i cannot change accent color, shape, size and the default one is looking very cheap must be because oneplus oxygen os is in my eyes but i am not overcome from oxygen os, oxygen os is lub funtouch os is very uncomfortable for me for the first <number>-<number> days but now im getting it a little. less feature in gaming mode in comparison to iqoo <number> camera- average as of now takes good picture in nightevening time and selfie camera is awsome. ois works good as per the budget and gives value for money. day time picture are good but something it changes the saturationcolor by itself automatically. no heat observed while gamingdoing heavy task minimal heat that every phone has now a days and it is <number> c outside so this is not a big deal for me. screen recorder and mic works awsome crisp clear display except the issue i told above <number>-<number> sot in one charge <number>-<number> <number>-<number> minutes charging time <number>-<number> no bugs lags observed till date <number> hz refresh rate made it monster some preinstalled bloatware can be uninstall but some has to be force stop only or you can use adb commande to remove permanently. a few apps are unnecessary like browser and a screen virus scan comes just after install an app from play store that very annoying and somehow i stopped that. speaker volume is sufficient enoug loud in a roomconclusion-in <number> k its worth for money with snapdragon <number> processor and intelligent chip.only thing that i dont like is funtoch os because it not gives a premium flagship phone experince.has some bugs as of now i.e, in gaming mode, in a few apps, camera, display that might fixed with future updates.overall worth for money, and yes you can pick it over oneplus <number> rt like i said youll probably feel bad for a week with its funtoch os but youll be okay with it after sometime.just because of oxygen os spending <number>-<number> k is not a great idea i think.,camera quality is good , video stability is awesome, processing and other functions are nice . ui is not that good and battery life is not upto the mark,pros- super fast app experience due to snapdragon <number>- super fast charging- good display but not comparable with super amoled of samsung other phone- good large display size- no heating in general use. only seen when using camera video call but it cools down fast.- accessories given with the phone like fast charger, usb c to <number> female adater, thin screen guard and translucent back cover.- ok cameracons- display is not super amoled or vivid like samsung a or s series phone- battery drains fast- avg front camera- earth current can be felt when touching back camera while charging.,i was skeptical about the phone would perform as sd <number> has its own share of heating issues and all, but for <number> k, this is one of the best phones in the segment.i had pixel <number> a and nothing phone <number> as other options. although their camera and software might be better in some aspects, the performance, the camera and gaming features this phone offers is incredible.also pixel and nothing phone dosent give charger in the box so its a plus point.the only issue i faced is when i switch the phone to <number> hz. it starts to act as it lowers to <number> fps or something. and the battery life is average. its <number> charge in the evening for sure. but decent battery coupled with a fast charger is more than enough.i use nova launcher with this and this solves the home screen style. recommended to all.,good display, good sound although sound is not much loud but have a sweet bass, smooth experience, camera good but front video could be given <number> fps, good haptic, every thing is good up to the mark but battery life could be better. overall satisfied with the product.,they

highhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh base,amazing,good","realme buds wireless design and specificationstruly wireless earphones are becoming very popular, and we could very well see realme get into that space in the coming months. however, for now, the company has taken on wireless headphones in an affordable form neckband-style earphones. the headset has a flexible neckband with metal modules at the ends, short cables that lead to the earbuds, and the plastic earbuds themselves. we quite liked the yellow-and-black colour scheme of our review unit. the design is simple and the build quality is decent. the device is light at just <number> g, and comfortable to wear and use for long hours at a stretch.like earlier realme earphones, the realme buds wireless have magnets in each earbud. while they dont serve any purpose on the wired models beyond keeping the two earbuds together, the magnetic clamp serves as the power switch for the realme buds wireless. separating the buds turns the headset on, while attaching them powers it down there is no power button, so this is the only way to control power on the headset.in theory this sounds good, but the weak magnets meant that the earphones separated easily when placed in a bag or pocket. this would turn the earphones on and automatically connect with our paired smartphone even when we didnt want it to, which was bothersome. calls would be automatically diverted away from the smartphones earpiece without us knowing, the battery would run down, and the phone wouldnt automatically connect to other devices such as a bluetooth car audio system.what you do get in the sales package are three pairs of silicone ear tips, ear wings that are pre-attached to the earbuds, and a micro-usb cable for charging. the charging port is on the underside of the right module, which also has the controls for playback, calls, and volume.the realme buds wireless earphones are powered by <number> mm drivers, with bluetooth <number> and support for the sbc and aac codecs. the earphones have a claimed battery life of <number> hours on a single charge, and are said to offer <number> minutes of listening time on a <number>-minute charge when the battery is drained. we were able to get around <number> hours of use in our testing, while a full charge of the headset took a little under <number> hours to complete. realme buds wireless performancethe realme buds wireless bring a refreshing change to the budget segment, offering a great combination of design and sound quality for the price. also, fans of electronic music will be happy to know that the realme buds wireless have been tuned with inputs from popular dj alan walker, and the sound does come across as geared for this genre. the wireless earphones with use aac bluetooth codecs. we listened to streamed music from spotify and youtube music, as well as our collection of high-resolution tracks.starting with take five by the dave brubeck quartet, we immediately noticed that the soundstage was considerably wider and more detailed than what were typically used to hearing from products in this price range. some of the percussion instruments sounded crisp and well defined, although the deeper elements in the middle of the track the double-bass, in particular was a bit soft and not quite as distinct as wed have liked. still, we found the sound to be detailed and rich on the whole.next, we listened to a bit of indian pop with an unplugged rendition of amar arshis kala chasma. apart from some gentle aggression in the low end, we also quite liked the inoffensive nature of the mids and highs, as demonstrated with the familiar vocals of the track. the sound of the realme buds wireless is tuned for comfort and near-universal appeal, and sticks to that brief. we heard just about as much detail and clarity as we could have hoped for from a pair of wireless earphones that cost less than rs. <number>the realme buds wireless as a hands-free headset for voice calls, and results were mixed. in some cases we found that voices on the other end of the call were soft, and our callers reported too much background noise a crow cawing about <number> feet away sounded as if it was coming from right next to us, for the person on the other end. on other occasions, no issues were reported, so call quality seems to be largely dependent on your surroundings and possibly the strength of your cellular signal. verdictmore expensive pairs of earphones such as the oneplus bullets wireless <number> and <number> more stylish dual dynamic driver might offer much more by way of sound quality, but the realme buds wireless does a capable job for just rs. <number>. this is a product worth considering simply because it is everything you need for the price.this headset is built well, has decent battery life, and is very comfortable to wear. the only significant problem for us was the magnetic power switch, which often led to the earphones automatically powering on at awkward times. that aside, the realme buds wireless is a pair of earphones that does exactly what its supposed to - no more and no less with unwavering consistency, and we like it for that.pros1 looks good2 light and comfortable3 detailed, rich sound for the pricecons1 magnetic power switch is troublesome2 inconsistent performance on voice callsratings out of <number> design comfort <number> audio quality <number> battery life <number> value for money <number> overall <number> go and purchased,first of all if you are a electronicdance and hiphop genre kind of enthusiast than your search for a good quality earphone still continues, its not like these earphones are worthless for these genres and cannot be listened on these, surely you can listen and enjoy it but you just could not get the vibes you get while listening those on deep base earphones.from my music listening experience from <number> years i can tell you that the depth and that vibrating surround base effect is not in this it surely has some thumpy bass which is required for perfect balance in every genre but due to lack of that deep base you will definitely regret your purchase if youre a hiphop edm lover the mid tones of music are a little low in this earphone which also ruins a little the experience of these genres song listening experience.this wanna makes me think everytime is alan walker really tuned thisfor trap hard dance genre its good but not the best.i can tell you such differences because i am also using a wired earphone namely mi earphones pro <number> rs which is excellent and produces very great sound for every genre and definitely have that deep base effect!!rather than for those genres song these earphones are really good for every other genres !!!if youre fine with the above listed drawbacks then only head towards the detailed review!!upsides1. the material quality is good, its plastic but feels like a soft silicon layer is applied over its top layer both on the neckband as well as the wires of the earplugs.2. these are extremely lightweight and doesnt feels a like extra load on your neck at all.3. noise cancellation is really very good, im really impressed.4. mic quality is also the best that can be offered in <number> range no complaints5. the earplugs fit is good but i advice you to remove those removable angular paddings for more snug fit

empty.12. did not get to experience its splash retention property.downsides1. the outer cover of earphones are of plastic good quality, but they would have given aluminium frame in this price.2. the wires should also be given as braided one for rough and long use3. no realme branding permanent anywhere on the earphone confuses us, but theres tag attached on the neckband4. the cap on the charging port should have given to prevent dust from entering.5. small carry case or pouch should have been given to make it travel friendly6. when connected to the device when there is an incoming call it doesnt recites the number of caller, and it sometimes doesnt notifies at all... but no major con is theresound quality1. the vocals are really amazing now i definitely understand the lyrics of pop songs <number>. the lows and highs of the songs are really great but mids are little supressed and you would definitely miss that in edm and hip-hop songs as that evary low details are not required in dance songs, the mids highs are more important3. the base is adequate and keeps the song alive but not produces that well deep and surround base that youngsters love, but it definitely has that amount of base required in any song to feel it, im also a younster and im fine with it as ive bought it as a secondary earphone for watching movies and series on tv silently without disturbing my family so this fulfills my purpose.4. the beat and sound produced feels natural and clear like high quality headphones and in this respect alan walker and realme team had surely done a great work.5. based on types of music lovers i would recommend this to- pop, indie-pop, acoustic, rb, rock and soft rock, traphard dance nearly all kinds of genres except edm and hip-hop...as ive bought it as a secondary earphone so i do not had any great expectations and i can surely say that it exceeded my expectations and im very happy with my purchase....please read the whole review it will surely help you decide more clearly.have a good purchasing experience, thakyou for reading!!!,best but little high price.6 to <number> month daily use he chal pata h ..,the base is so loud. you cant listen for long, you will get ear pain after <number> hour. who like highhhhhhhhh base they can choose and sound quality ok. quality is good,best product,good

and is perfect choice for those who are looking for a budget wireless speaker for their laptop or mobile phone with low volume issues or for those who need some portable music device and who dont want to shell out lot of money. it serves these purpose very well and is not pricey. why i am saying all thisfirst things first, i got this at <number> the black one only as rest of the colors were way too pricey and choice of colors can be sacrificed in such a case. <number>. my laptop and phone volume is too low and watching a video or listening to music on these devices is not a good experience. so here too this speaker served the purpose as connectivity is excellent, size of speaker is conveniently small, lightweight and battery backup is damm awesome. after a complete charge i used this

than <number> charge and i just topped it to full. bluetooth connectivity is exceptionally good upto <number> mtrs. fm reception is average without connecting the datacharging cable but it is awesome

issues. voice clarity is very good for the calls made. music clarity is not very good. read cons for this. quality of the plastics used seems good and feels durable.cons. sound quality is just average. voice call clarity is very good where music is not dominant. but when it comes to music, this speaker struggles to deliver quality. people are complaining in reviews that it doesnot produce any bass, but actually its is the bass produced by the speaker which deteriorates the quality. this is understandable for this product as it just has one tiny speaker inside and if manufacturer makes it to produce some bass will definitely deteriorate the music quality. but this is manageable and you can adjust the music equalizers in your laptop or phone to get pretty decent music quality. this is the reason i dont consider its music quality a con for the product. theres one limitation about charging connector to. it comes with a charging port compatible to ab type connector, so if you have a charger with data cable supporting c type connectors, you are bound to use the charging cable supplied with speaker only. so you cannot keep just one common cable with you to charge both your phone and speaker. instead you will have to carry two different cables. this speaker does not come with a charger, so you will have to use your mobiles charger <number> v, <number> a for the purpose. but for the price rage, this seems reasonable.useful tip for buyers most of the smart phones will display battery percentage left in the speaker. but you can install any of these two apps bluebatt or

terms of features or design over the <number> years or so ive been using them. and regardless of which brand name is stamped on them, they look like clones of each other. it was therefore with some

users could come into accidental contact with. but quite a bit of my excitement drained away when the heater arrived. i couldnt use it straightaway because it has a cord thats barely a metre long, and it just couldnt reach the <number> a socket it needs to be plugged into. such heavy-duty sockets are normally positioned high in most bathrooms, so that they are easily accessible to any storage water-heaters that may be installed. havells should have made allowances for this and added at least another foot-and-a-half to the cord length. for a large-scale manufacturer, this extra length would

cant be any stool lying around in your home it has to be a stool of a certain height, about <number> inches for me. any taller, and the bucket cant be accommodated under the tap any shorter, and you begin cursing havells again for their miserliness with the cord. the stool took two days to arrive, and i inaugurated the heater a full four days after it was delivered. thank god my old immersion heater was still usable, in spite of its heavily calcified condition.there is yet another problem with this heater though it helpfully allows you to choose between three temperature settings, you dont know what value each setting corresponds to. what does high temperature mean -- <number> degrees celsius seventy i found out the hard way when i set the temperature high, and the heater wouldnt switch itself off for <number> minutes, which is five minutes longer than the time my old heater takes to heat up some <number> litres of water. and by then, the water had turned scaldingly hot. i tried the medium setting the next day, and again had the nasty experience of having to deal with extra hot water. perhaps the right setting is low then. im not sure. neither the product literature that came with the heater nor the havells website has any information that will help you choose the right setting, and stop you burning yourself.so both the innovative features of this heater that made me buy it -- the variable heat setting and the auto-cut-off-- ultimately turned out to be quite useless. i still have to depend on my instinct, and on my experience with my old featureless heater, and manually turn the heater off when i think its done its job.i have a question for other users of this product, or for the manufacturer can the temperature be set to in-between values, something between low and medium, for instance. the way the controlling knob is marked, with several lines between the presets, suggests this is possible. or maybe thats yet another useless feature of this fancy heater. more trial-and-error but should such a basic piece of equipment be so difficult to useupdateafter a weeks use of this heater, id like to add a word of caution for the benefit of other buyers and users. since the heater has its own indicator light, which switches off at the set temperature, you may forget to switch the socket switch off, particularly if the switch is away from the socket, as in some contemporary bathrooms that have all switches bunched together at the bathroom door. if you forget to switch the socket off, and, in the meantime, have removed the heater from the bucket, it will begin to heat up again once the temperature has fallen below the set value. this dry-heating will damage both the heater and wall, if youve hung the heater up. but, more significantly, it will also be extremely hazardous if your body is wet, and theres no one around to switch the socket off for you. this happened to me twice. call me dumb, if you want to, but please be careful.,the product is good and does its work. i didnt find any use of the thermostat feature as though it turns off automatically the low temper in itself is very hot. it take just <number> to <number> mins to get the water be bath ready. further the product says that ilthe rod should not touch the bucket but the product handle is made in such a way that it touches, but that causes no trouble. its not shock proof so dont check temperature of water with it turned on.,product received with some scratchesdont know how inside package product gets scratchesother than that all is okay product is goodand its shock proof for extra safety but no recommended to touch water,value for money,product is good satisfactory, one minor issue the cord is little too hard.,its working as expected. no issues found till now but i have observed the red light is not coming fully. i could see only partial red light is visible. overall best product,nice,this product is very good and easy to use but its plug is of <number> amps which should have been of <number> amps",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31flPimoFpL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

the laptops screen framethe product is sturdy, invisible for the mutual color theme for device and product, and well manufactured. if the device has the same matte black theme, this webcam cover can easily be merged and becomes a part of the devices body. as you can see my laptop has a matte black screen frame and astonishinglythe product has merged with it. the little plastic container in the package will act as storage for the rest of the webcam covers.it is ultra-thin as described by the company withacquiring about a millimeter thickness. this thickness can cope with the windowslaptops as they are havingthe rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as a spacer between the screen and the lower-up bodykeyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screen.this spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lidwill not harm the screen, screen frame, and laptop lower-up body. but, still, dont put pressure on the location where the webcam cover is installed as the thickness of the webcam cover is slightly more in the micrometers, than the rubber buffers of the laptop itself. the sliding function is very smooth, but be sure to push only the slider part and not the whole static part as it will make the grip weak over time of usage.the device can be used with any phone and monitor as they have no issue with opening and closing the lids.now, for the mac laptop users, it is not a product for yourlaptop, and never try this product for your mac laptops. as the mac laptops have a stunning plain glass screen that is covering the whole screen frame part and has no spacers, that is theres no space left after closing the laptop lid and hence upon installation of thisproduct will damage crackbreak the plain glass screen.installation is easy, remove the blue tape and carefully stick the cover as a sticker, using the scale for support, or else you could stick it a little inclined. after sticking, rub your palm for heat generation and grab the screen frame from both palms and apply the ultra-light pressure and hold the position up to a good <number> to <number> minutes. and there you go for your satisfied invisible life.important -

notice the static frame of the webcamcover, and make its edges the edges close to the slider smooth rounding off or fillet, so that upon sliding the slider with a fat finger, it can easilyslide over the edges of the static frame hence do not put an unnecessary force on a static frame.to the seller - well packagingto the consumer - check for the rubber spacersbuffers provided in the laptop like windows laptops, if it is then you can use the webcam cover, if not like mac laptops, its not the product for you. even for windows laptops, after installing a webcam cover, try not to put pressure on the webcam cover location for long. slide it <number>-<number> times once a week to avoid jamming.disclaimerthe reviews and ratings hasve been made upon personal usages experiments experiences perspectives for specific products acquired delivered.,i usually dont trust my webcam so i thought of giving this product a try. it was delivered within <number> days after placing the order. i received it on <number> th june. first impressions were really good. i always had a fear that it would crack my screen when i close my laptop lid after reading the reviews but its been <number> months and theres not even a single crack in my screen. .you will get <number> webcams covers in the package. its extremely thin. so, it wont cause any issues when you close the laptophp pavilion gaming used here but it might cause issues in the case of laptops with thin screens like macbook air, asus tuf, asus rog while closing the lid due to the pressure on the screen. at the end its your choice. i am sorry to say that the adhesion of this product is quite weak. it literally falls off after a week of applying it. i had to throw <number> of it as it became useless. i only had the last piece remaining. eventually i was able to find a solution for this problem. remove the stock adhesion by gently applying isopropyl alcohol. then apply a strong adhesive glue i used fevi kwick. apply it only on the back edges of the webcam cover. since its extremely thin, i used thin needle to apply super glue gently on it or else the superglue will spill out and make a mess. immediately you have to place it on the webcam of our laptop. and then youre good to go.its been <number> months after using the super glue technique. forget about about falling, it has not even moved a bit. no effect on the quality of my webcam. the cover wont interfere when you are using your webcam in meetings. and fully covers it when you want privacy. overall, its a good product except for the fact that it has poor adhesion.,good product,i wish i had known this before ordering. luckily a friend made me aware the very same day i had applied it.apple urges people not to close their macbook, macbook air or macbook pro, while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your macbook!!! it may also affect the ambience light sensor, but that is the lesser issue as compared to a potentially cracked screen and high repair costs.macbooks are designed in a way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper <number> mm should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop. this item is <number> inches thick, that is <number> mm, six times the recommended thickness!!!if you are going to use it on your macbook, be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop. you can use it without worry on imac as its a desktop and doesnt get closed. you can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isnt embedded inside the glass screen. if you have a laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okay.for disappointed macbook users like me there are two options. one is you trust apple, who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light. according to them one cannot work without the other, so even if someone hacks your camera, you will know it is on because the green light will be glowing.if youre not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera, use a piece of thin tape. apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen, but frankly, if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing, i dont see how there could be an issue.why am i still giving this product <number> stars it reached in good condition, is easy to install and use, and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera. its not a bad product. they just need to stop advertising it for macbooks!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41PeQz-jDSL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

i mostly will be using these while my walking and workout sessions, so i think my mind wont be nitpicking then. ill soon be upgrading though.overall, really a very decent purchase with good sound quality provided you can get these for under <number> k. cheers!,hey. .this one item has a built quality is like a stone..and also the working condition and sound quality it is marvelous, but only one problem is the noise cancellation that not working properly which means when we are in a crowded area while recording something or a call to another person the unwanted noises are coming they cannot hear properly our voice thats the only disadvantage on this one..,right buds not performs well, i am trying to change music to next but it still plays the same which should not happen according to manual,been using these for a month now. cant massively complain, the sound quality is decent enough may not be good enough for big music heads, not enough bass and provides good noise isolation. very impressed by the battery life with the charging case, and i use it every day. if you can snag it on a deal for <number> bucks its a fantastic deal.,my only issue is, we cant change the connection to <number> devices by <number> click. every thing else is fine.,best at price. and require some button for operation.,call pick up rejection function, next song play function not working on single touch,product is good but battery not as expected",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41vEB+mY55L._SY300_SX300_.jpg

to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style. to be true samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique tws.this is not an inear style tws but resembles somewhat earbud style tws, only of its kind in the market as far as my knowledge goes.they are held very good in my ears, gives me a good seal and does not fall out strange as i cant use earbuds because they fall out frequently. it seems that samsung has finalised the shape after a good homework. however, it doesnt mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globe.the finish, build and all such generic factors are top notch. the size of the buds and the case is very small.now about the sound. if the buds fit in ones ears with a good seal, the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect, it may be tinny.the sound signature is very bassy for my taste and i have to eq it to my taste. the bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get a taste of the treble. i listen it in treble boost mode adjusted through the app. anc works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable. in contrary, anc on somewhat opens up the sound. dont buy this for anc.strangely to me, these buds sound better on my iphone <number> mini than my galaxy s22 spotify and apple music. the buds have app support for both android galaxy wear and ios galaxy buds live but the android app is more feature packed and works better. the ios app couldnt update the firmware although there is a menu in the app and always showed the device to be on latest firmware. however, as soon as i connected with my s22, on pairing, the first thing it did was to update the firmware.i love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for <number> k against an mrp of <number> k. the do sound very good but does not suit my taste. persons loving bass may love them. dont get them for anc. battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok. it has wireless charging too. if your ears are too small or too large than normal - better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper seal.,best call quality. noise cancelling could have been improved to best, but still wotks good.descent battery life.music is good. not to that top notch, but good in this segment.overall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but good.,i am using this for like <number> months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its price.,bluetooth range is not that good,the sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat. i got these for rs.5290, it almost felt like a steal deal for me until i faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds. the bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance. it feels like i am using bluetooth v3.0. the range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket, the audio starts stuttering. the mic quality is a hit or miss, inside the house it works very well, but outside it performs poorly. i think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphones quality. if you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception, then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing. samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault. i pity those who bought it at around <number> k for such a flawed product. even at rs <number> k it is not worth it because of the range issue. it is better to buy a wired iem, atleast it will sound better than this.,in this price samsung brand is goodeasy to wear and good battery backuphardly support the <number> meter bluetooth connectivity",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Sx7+mu+vL._SY300_SX300_.jpg

headphones for watching movies and online classes,very noise,average quality,nice experience in this headphone","stopped working after a month of use. dont waste your money on this product,everything is best but build quality is avg,lets get directly into the pros cons -sry it will be a long review coz the review have to be useful for everyone who plans to buy this.pros- the price, given to this price bracket its the best one i can suggest from the built quality to the audio quality its superior for the price <number>- i got for this price tagthen the comfort, everybody complaining about the earpads i dont know why, if your going for over the ear type u have to be known that u cant wear it all day long the most expensive products also tend to warm your ears and get a little uncomfortable, so if its not preffered u can go for earphones or earbuds. as i bought multiple ober the ear headphones there will be rought cloth like texture that will irritate your ears, but this one has soft cushion like material, im really comfortable with this one.and next the audio quality, i have previosuly owned boult in-ear earphones so i know the bass quality and vocal quality, so i booked this without even thinking twice, and it has delivered what it can. the best part is im really comfortable in this one than my in-ear earphones, the sound is even better and you dont get high volume levels like those local cheap products on the markets. but the bass and clarity will give you some extra feel, especially the bass.. its really engaging, if ur a bass lover go for it.then the quality, i know the boult for sometime but for over the ear headphones at this price point i was little skeptical about the build quality before the delivery and it suprised me, dont think that build quality is extraordinary like sennheiser or sony coz ur not paying that much for this, so for this price its so good, even better than the boat headphones which is slightly high in the price tag.now cons- little skeptical about the warranty, because when i gone to register this and both while i was registered my boult in-ear earphones, they didnt asked for invoice slips and no serial number is asked, then how can they proceed if we call for the warranty claims... but hopefully i think this will last long as seeing the quality. next is the cable quality, i didnt complaining about it, but they mentioned in amazon as its an kevlar cable, so i expected a lott but its a normal cable bt its sturdy enough. i didnt check the mic on it, i make a call on this, the other person was able to understand me, but i dont know hows the quality.to help you guys, i have metioned every aspect in detailed manner so it can helpful for people who spend their valuable money coz every single rupee counts..have a nice and safe shopping. bye,achhi product he,got the product delivered unharmed in <number> days.i got it for <number>.this is the best branded product in this price range.sound quality is pretty good considering the price.bass is good but the loudness is a bit low, you have to listen them above the <number> level of your mobile.clearity is very good.i bought them for online lectures and they worked great for the purpose.ear cups are comfortable and reduces much background noise, besides they arent known for passive noise cancellation.the wire attached to the ear cups is a bit delicate and may break if pulled forcefully so you have to handle it carefully.i have attached a pic with side by side comparison of my old boat rockerz <number> which i bought for <number> in <number> and they lasted for a very long duration of <number> years.the boult audio q2 looks a bit delicate as compared to boat rockerz, but dont forget theres a double price difference between them.lets see how long it goes....summing up this is the best product in this price segment <number>. just go for it if you get the same.,noise level is so high i couldnt listen more than <number> minutes.. so i like to choose another brand please refund for this product,quality not as expected level,i use this product for mostly in gaming and listening songs but there are no mic in it",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31IO--RzGbL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

loud.3. battery as a person whos shifting from a normal <number> hz device phone , i was very worried about the battery life of this device at <number> hz but it surprised me very well ..initially i thought i would need to switch to <number> hz for better battery life for daily usage.but i didnt even thought this device would give this much great battery life at <number> hz.at <number> hz , i am getting around <number> hours of minimum sot screen on time .the maximum sot i got at <number> hz is <number> hours <number> minutes.i didnt checked battery life at <number> hz because i didnt use it at <number> hz even a single day . the battery life is excellent.4. rear cameras i am not a very good photographer or something , i am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionally.i was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very well..added some camera samples above pic <number> ultrawide , pic <number> telephoto pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading both the three cameras primary ultrawide telephoto performs very well.if youre a camera guy you should definitely check this out.5. performance ram management im not a gamer , i use my device for daily usage of social media , ott platforms , calls , messages etc. but i use it extremely.i didnt faced any kind of heating issues with the device until now.also ,ram management of the device is excellent , i am a person who uses <number>-<number> appsbackground at single time and i didnt have any issues of closing down the apps <number>. one ui i was a stock android guy , but one ui actually surprised me , it is very well optimised and very user-friendly for single hand usage..initial days i found it little hard to use the stock menu of one ui but im now got used to it.ps i didnt found any kind of ads on my device as i didnt sign up or used any samsung apps.7. build quality even though its back is made up of plastic , the overall build quality is super premium the aluminium frame gives us a feel like using a flagship device..8. future proof the device has <number> <number> g bands , ip68 rating , wireless charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracket.ip68 wireless charging are mostly only found on flagship devices . its good to see samsung brings it at lower price.this is the best future proof device as of now.so these are the major pros i noticed as of now .now lets move to the cons.cons <number>. no hdr support on netflix as an extensive multimedia user , i found it very frustrating. even mid range devices offering hdr support on netflix , samsungs flagship killer doesnt have hdr support.it will not be fixed via ota update <number>. no <number> gb variant this is actually not a problem for most of the people but as a power user who uses dual sim , i found it little difficult.but if youre a single sim user , luckily it have hybrid solution ..so you can use a sim card expandable memory card ...3. gorilla glass <number> other competitors are providing atleast gg5 in this price range. but s20 fe <number> g has just gg3 which also im not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere .but at the end of the day , glass is glass it will broke.4. no headphone jack it is not any kind of unusual thing .most of the phones above <number> k segment doesnt have headphone jack.so we have to buy <number> mm to type c adapter , type c earphones or bluetooth solutions .note only buy original samsung type c adapter else it may not support.5. no <number> w charger it is not actually a con for me as i prefer low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage .but it may be a con for you , although the device supports <number> w charging . only <number> w charger is provided inside the box .. they should have given <number> w inside the box.i didnt have any issues with <number> w charger but it would be great if they bundle it with <number> w as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speed.for the reference of charging speed ,both <number> w <number> w will full charge the device almost at the same time but using <number> w you can get about <number> within <number> minutes where as <number> with <number> w charger.full charge time i usually takes is <number> hour and <number> minutes.6. front camera i am not a selfie guy , but if youre a person whos looking for a selfie device just dont buy it . its not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but its not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price rangeconclusion if youre a person who wants a device for normal day to day usage with good battery life , great rear cameras , great performance , better software support , better build quality and use it for more than <number> years the cons mentioned above doesnt bother youjust buy it , i am sure you wont be disappointed.,its been about <number> days since i got this phone. i got it for <number> on prime day sale. for the price its good.pros <number>. camera. coming from poco x2, the camera quality on this is amazing according to the price. it gives you good colours, contrast, focus, and everything that you want. it has ois which is very apparent while recording. at <number> k60 the stability is worse. but set it to <number> p60 and the videos will be amazingly stable. and the main advantage of ois other than stable video is great night mode shots. hold the phone stable for a while and along with ois you will get great photos with accurate colors and nice exposure. attached samples.2. display absolutely best. samsung displays are the best. <number> hz fhd. flows smoothly. colors and calibration is top notch. brightness is good but i felt its a little insufficient under direct sunlight. its visible but could be better.3. oneui the main reason for upgrading to this phone was software. oneui4.0 is the absolute best android skin right now. it has way too many customisations in it and lets you personalise your phone to a very high degree. like theres a feature to read out the name of the person whos calling if your wearing headphones. it took me <number> days to fully go through all the settings and change them to my needs. also knoxx security is a special mention. knoxx security is a software and hardware feature in samsung phones which protects your phone from all kinds of attacks and keeps your data safe. even if it gets stolen you can remotely delete all your data. secure folder allows you to store data in a separate storage. and many more such good features. while being a very feature rich and storage heavy skin, it still feels very very smooth and fast to use. unlike miui or other skins, it doesnt stutter much and bugs are less.there are many other small pros like good stereo speakers. nice premium build quality. good data and wifi speeds. other such features that you wont notice but definitely make a difference in your experience.cons1. software. i know i said its a pro but i say this in the aspect of updates. this phone was launched in <number> march in india and samsung promises <number> year android version updates and <number> additional year of security updates. but theres a lot of confusion regarding if or not this phone will receive android <number>. it will receive a13 for sure. theres a lot of debate on what they will do with14 because of global version launch date being earlier and yada yada. basically the phones life maybe <number> to <number> years if they give a14. but <number> to <number> if not. i researched on the internet a few people say that it will receive a14 while i was few say its not. its hard to say whos correct. so assume its not getting a14 if you are going for it.2. battery. the battery on this phone is <number> mah and its good enough for a days use. but thats because i use it lightly. not much online streaming. no gaming light social media and other usual stuff. if you use it even a tad bit more heavily, you will run out within a day. if youre going outside for the better part of a day,like a day trip to somewhere nearby,its better keep a power bank handy. in terms of screen on time numbers, i once got <number> hours of sot on light usage, <number> hr youtube and <number> hr streaming. i was at home and used wifi all the time.i got <number> hrs sot when i went outside for a day trip. i took many photos and videos and the phone shutdown before i could reach home. on a mixed use day, you can get <number> to <number> hours of sot.final verdict the life of the phone in terms of software support is not great but you will get on time updates and almost no bugs in the software. so if you want to buy it you can and exchange it after maybe <number> years for other models. but if you planning on using it for longer than <number> years, better avoid it. in the upcoming diwali and dussera sales, the price might further drop to <number> k even. i am just speculating but keep in mind your requirements and go accordingly.as always amazing delivery by amazon.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ezRvTwcaL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

which only streamed <number> k a few times. <number> p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. no dolby vision support - which i made my peace with considering the fact that <number> of budget tvs in the market cant produce the contrast youd expect out of dv content anyways, so why care. you get hdr, and hdr content is definitely better looking than non-hdr ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. i planned to use the tv without cable, but the tv does come with some channels like republic tv, bloomberg, <number> xm, etc., these stream in <number> p, so a great bonus to have.remotevery basic rf remote, unlike bluetooth ones on most new tvs. the remotes looks pretty sleek and stylish, but thats about it. biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, youll need to use the d-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. you can control the tv using samsungs smartthings app, but guess what -

far from certain places in my house. that time the robot needs to be brought back to the wifi range. <number> ghz connection does not work with this model.3. the robot takes anywhere between <number>-<number> minutes to completely vaccum my <number> sq. ft house. battery life is really good in the new model. <number> or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house. charging is also not bad. it took <number> hrs for it to charge full <number> the first time.4. couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and i had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again. once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for a couple of times, it would not repeat this behavior.5. dusting is of a1 quality. each time the amount of dust collected is staggering. we never knew we had so much dust in our house!<number>. mopping is average. i would call it light wiping and not mopping. hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping. only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out. adding a bit of floor cleaning liquid or vim liquid in the water helps.7. vacuum mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness. in this mode, mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick up.i recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles.8. keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt, and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house. this is not ideal. so its important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping.9. the mop works horribly on door mats main door or bathroom mats. it gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place. so please remove all the mats, esp. during mopping session.10. noise levels are pretty low in medium mode. sometimes we dont even know where it has gone, it gets so quiet.pros. battery life suction power noise levels vacuumingcons mopping is average. its at best can be called as light wiping. setup is bit tricky, user manual is insufficient. xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home. you have to figure it out using youtube videos. i can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing. once the device is confused it doesnt correct itself automatically. it needs a map reset. door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before mopping.such tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your own.but i still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house clean.,prosfor cleaning dust it is very good .we can set daily schedule.even if we forget to do so it will automatically does the work by setting schedule ...cleaning the box after its work is also not very hectic..brushes are providing..we can set restricted areas.conesmost of the hairs n threads are stuck through the round main brush.. little difficult to clear the brush.it has been more than <number> year iam using this.one time the movement is low .when ichecked..so many hairs are stucked in its wheel.it was little difficult to clear the hair strands.mopping it is average only..only takes very little amount of water.so oily things will remain in the floor..once or twice in week we have to do mopping with plenty of water and lizol..it cant reach the sharp corners also.once we create restricted area..by the time of using it couldnt detect the proper area we marked..so it enter those area and get stuck most of the times.it is main thing i hate about this product..remaining things are okay....then we have to reset the map and set restricted area again..it is bit annoyingoverall it is very good for me...my brooming is almost completely replaced by this ...once in week i do the complete cleaning with broom to all areas that didnt covered by this machine ..,in all other aspect like, price, battery,app feature, suction and cleaning its really very good product.i find it very useful and nice to have product.so will directly make note of some drawbacksimprovent area, i observed.1 sometimes it gets confused or leaves a specific section of bedroom even though there has been no obstacle.2 its little noisy or i will say not a silent thing in standard suction power, though that with any vaccuum cleaner.3 xiaomi could have provides extra hepa filter with it.4 vaccummop doesnt clean properly and rather sticks dust to floor because of wet brush, so i do vaccum and then only mop subsequently is best option.5 charging is super slow, if compared with any <number> mah battery with mobile fast charger, its <number> times slower despite such, a big docking charger.,i am a bachelor and i do not like maid coming to my house.this solves the purpose. it is great at vacuuming my <number> sqft house. it can do it on turbo mode with dual cleaning in single battery life. was surprised with the vacuum power and battery life. it collects way more dust than the manual brooming.it can skip corners and narrow places. once in a while i just broom the corners and bring the dust in the middle before turning the robot on.55 for navigation and room mapping.mopping is equally bad. mop does not cover whole area and it leaves trails. it leaves the floor looking worse than the un mopped floor. also water tank broke in just few cleanings.recommended for vacuuming purpose.,very good product. very helpful product in my home.,we purchased the product in april and now it is not working.after charging it is running for less than one minute and getting stopped,easy to use and working well little bit of noise is there but acceptable.,helping hand. more reliable than maids. does the job well. once in <number> days you need to mop yourself. good suction power.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31grDt8hrBS._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

yeah, and not booming bass. its so great and im quite surprised it sounds like something youd expect at a higher price point. <number> soundstage as soon as the headphone is switched on, it starts in battery saving mode. once you turn on dirac opteo mode, you can literally feel the space opening up. all the instruments feel individual and sound separated. fireflies by owl city sounds lovely and all the strings sway in the centre while the various zaps and buzzes surround you. its really great for the price! <number> treble and mids clean and clear. the bass doesnt overpower them and feels just right. the vocals come out clearly and all the instruments dont interfere with it drive home by steven wilson sounds great!. <number> bass punchy and tight. i love how it fizzles in bonfire by knife party and how it reverberates in turn down for what by dj snake. breakin a sweatby skrillex, zedd sounded tight and i discovered how well produced it is! lovers of tight bass, this is your product!<number>. volume it gets really loud. so loud that i cant listen to it at the highest setting. but if thats your thing, then you should know that the highs get pretty shrill at the setting, but the bass is still pretty clean and loud!<number>. anc anc is present, but wont drown everything out. its a great add on but if youre looking for a headphone to make all sounds around you zero, then this wont do that. if you need to drown out some noise while you listen to your tunes, this will do the trick! <number> ambient sound mode the opposite of anc, it pulls in the outside noise to let you have a conversation. again, you cant blast tunes at high volume and still have a convo, but you can listen with lower volume near <number> volume and hear things around you. if the ambient sound also increased as i increased volume, it would have been amazing.4. calling did a couple of calls. with no-noise, the other person said i sounded great! i took a couple of calls in a local grocery store was pretty loud and the other end had no issue hearing me.5. buttons the button placement is easy and i didnt feel any issue getting used to the controls. the simple manual explains everything in <number> mins, so read once and youre good to go. <number> to note the sound is best in dirac opteo mode. every time you turn it on, you have to double press the multi function button to turn it on. id have loved having it on by default. also every time i turn it on, it plays a <number>-<number> second tune, which could have been shorter. imagine hearing it every time you turn the thing on. ugh.6. connectivity once i connected it to my phone the first time, it connects to my phone within <number>-<number> seconds of turning the earphones on.7. battery it seems to last long! ive been using them for about <number> hrs and its gone down about <number>. cannot say anything more yet though. <number> when you take both the earphones out of your ears, it doesnt auto pause like some of the competitors. annoyed that this was missed, would have saved so much more battery if they did this.8. build quality i have a black version. its made with good quality plastic and didnt feel heavy around my neck. it doesnt have metal anywhere, and its quite simple. i think it looks decent.9. exercise need to test! will update later.in summary, an easy recommendation. if you can overlook the small issues, theres a great sounding, feature-packed and long lasting device here at a great price! <number> would definetely recommend!,first i was bit sceptical about the build quality but have to say its got a pretty sturdy material and decent quality buttons, bass is good, vocals are much clearer in crystal bionic mode, anc is working to a degree will definitely cancel out the noise of your celing fan but dont except any more than that, no issues with call enx is working upto its name, battery is sufficient around <number>-<number> hours if you mix up the modes.. overall a decent all rounded neckband, jack of all and king of none.,all other things such as sound quality, battery backup are very good but multiple device pairing is implemented very poorly. if i connect with laptop and try to connect with phone at same time. it does not work many times. if headphones are connected to laptop and you close the laptop without shutting it down then you wont be able to connect with phone again unless and until you disconnect with laptop. this is a big bug. please fix this.,this boat <number> anc neckband is very good but needs improvement and fixes.pros- nice sound quality while using crystal bionic sound, but its average on normal mode which feels a little more bassy and losses clarity at certain points. great build quality its anc ambience mode is good in this price range. its quite comfortable to wear for long sessions as per my ear fitting. it has dual pairing which is very good but its not very seamless and there is a small issue with dual pairing, e.g., while receiving a call on one device, the audiovideo being played at another device wont pause you have to manually pause instead there wont be any sound output through that device. its a little issue but it would have been great if the video gets paused while receiving a call on another device, as this is available on boat rockerz <number> and a few different boat neckbands.cons- its range is very low considering bluetooth v5.2, i even have boat neckband with v5.0 which has better range. even a single wall coming in between <number>-<number> ms can block the sound output. its battery life is average which needs charge every day if you use it for roughly <number>-<number> hours everyday with bionic crystal modeanc enabled. while using dual pairing sometimes there are sound drops and lags in between. and the sound gets high pitched and starts lagging sometimes if you switch quickly between devices. this happened on the replacement unit i received, maybe its not the case with your unit. sometimes no sound is received while playing audio from both devices. i dont know if its wrong with my unit or every unit.overall this is a good and considerable neckband under <number> k if you want good bass-rich sound quality, ancambience mode and descent battery life.but if your requirements mostly is dual pairing, then this is not for you. as i bought this considering dual pairing feature most importantly. but its not really seamless in between devices, but still its the best possible available feature in this price range or even under <number> k but it needs improvements and fixes to make it more seamless and efficient.another problem with dual pairing is that the media doesnt gets paused on first device if theres a call on the second one, which is already there on boats few other neckbands, but then there is no media-pause feature on them. e.g., if audio is being played on <number> devices first device audio will get paused if audio is played on second device and vice-versa.so do try it out by yourself. because its my personal experience with the neckband, maybe you get a better experience.thanks for reading. happy shopping!,bought this one after using rockerz <number> pro for over <number> years now. comparing this with that, that one was ergonomically better, felt snug in ears.standalone review of this.1. noise cancellation is just alright, not too great, not too bad.2. sound quality is definitely great and excellent with the bionic sound feature. kudos on that part.3. bass quality is fairly good at this price point.4. holds charge for as long as advertised.5. overall bulky nature of the neckband puts you off and then the finish is poor too around the control buttons making it look very tacky cheap atleast on the funky grey one which i bought because it was priced lowest.conclusiongood product at a fair price i.e. nothing too great but nothing bad either.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31gzRr9mIaS._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

the sound and video lag with distance while connecting bluetooth with headphones.pairing with headphones difficult need to wait longfeels volumes low.,i got this to add-on to a high-end system, which traditionally doesnt have the facility. however its often requested when guests come over. i was using a phoenix transreceiver, but the constant need of charging and the single indicator led made it difficult to integrate into this kind of application. the optical out is connected to a dual ess9028 dac, and the device used for transmission is the ipad air.this lacks a battery, which is a big differentiator. this means it is not exactly portable, and the form factor reinforces that feature. it is intended to be a desktop unit, and it comes with a reasonable set of cables. the quality of the included cables is quite poor, so its best to use something else.compared to the direct input from usb, the overall sound is poorer, with a shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble. still, this is being used in a high-end system - i suspect with many lesser speakerampdacs it will be acceptable. at maximum output, the level is about <number>-<number> db lower than a direct usb connection to the dac.it is around the same as my signature acoustics unit, which is <number> rd the size but uses a battery, and doesnt have a volume control or the bypass feature, or the nice display which is handy if you are close by.the bypass is one of the highlights of this device, it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough, and allows you to use both bt and another optical sourcereceiver - though only either can be used at a time.the build quality is average. it is lightweight enough that a set of decent cables will tip it over backwards, hence the thin cables supplied. the onboard volume control is nice, if a bit redundant given everybody uses their handheld or other device to control volume i use the dac remote. it also has only <number> clicks, so the control will be very coarse. the display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low, it is sufficient for the tasks.overall, its quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices. the sound quality limitations of bt transmission compulsory resampling and lossy compression, among others cannot be overcome even with the fanciest devices and protocols, so id rank it close to the top of what you can get as an add-on for a hifi system. for more normal usage, there are cheaper options available.,excellent product,bluetooth range is very less,bought it to connect my old sony <number> blueray home theater with mi <number> k box which does not have optical sound port. it has an spdif optical port which can connect to the home theater optical in",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/315GvM3Qq6S._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

small and large. package includes some noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction card.build was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting. will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded. the earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand. they fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the case.comfort this is very subjective and each ear is different. its one of the reaonss i wanted to get a cheap tws to see if im ok with the form factor for long hours. the prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so i switched to the small size ones. and after about <number> mins i forgot i was even wearing them. the earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they dont cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use. one thing to note is that if you have gandhi ears then the fit might be a little awkward - i should know. my ears covered the touch areas of the buds so i had to fiddle around a bit if i wanted to do any of the touch actions. ymmv.sound quality i liked them. im no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation. i tried my usual test at httpsyoutu.bej0 a2 prcmqo and they fared quite well. the treble maxes out at <number> khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point. there was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below <number> hz but the l and r drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent. i feel this definitely punches above its price point.call quality in a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good. there was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear. but things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like youre inside a well. seems the mics cant figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality. overall you get what you pay for here.range max i got was around <number> m. not sure how they tested and got <number> m as advertised. any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so i guess thats passable.pairing ------ update on <number> th aug <number> - - - - - -major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone. you have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again. had issues like only one of the buds pairing as well.have to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenient.---------------i dont have a phone to test the fast pair features - actually im not even sure these support it. anyway, the earphones go into pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case and i was able to pair with no problems on multiple phones. they will auto pair post this initial setup to previously paired devices. i could not find any way to control the pairing mode though. you have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does. they switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved a little.battery life way too early to tell anything. will share my experience post one week and one month. but they came around <number> charged in the box and i have stated to charge the case - box says it will take <number> hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like a flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done. the earphones also have leds that blink red white to indicate pairing, low battery etc.sync issues none so far. but have seen many such reports and reviews wherein the l and r earphones seem to go out of sync on similar low price twses. so will see if i face any such problems.these are the primary areas that i am concerned with while evaluating any tws so will share how my experience is after a while. so far im happy with them.,hi, my name is akshay.i used this product and this is very good in sound and valuable money.good in calling also.everything is perfect.,good sound quality...,buds are very good quality. with great noise cancellation feature.,when we received this order box is already opened like this.i was not expected at all.,what i dont like is the earpads, sometime it came out dont know the reason even i tried different fits. rest is great.,amazing sound,it is the best choice for the product",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31oumlyiGiL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

id say being a va panel, i can clearly see blacks are not so deep they are bit of greyish kind, however, colours are not over saturated, i felt they are normal and when i looked at tv from sides i can clearly say it doesnt come near to ips panel display. but, yeah for an average user like me its sufficient.2- remote- its simple, major apps hotkeys are given. yt, amazon prime video, hotstar which is good. voice assistant is enabled. simple and user friendly experience. it lacks hands free google assistant.3- sound- i personally felt if <number> watts audio given in the tv it would have been great, but only <number> watts given which is crisp and clear though i increased volume upto <number> to chk, but no distortions nothing its clear dialogues and bass, but if a soundbar is added it will be added advantage.4- ui- it comes with android <number> it doesnt matter to me as im a very average user so runs the show for me, i hope hisense sends the ota update5-now to the main point as u can see my pictures, i see specially in amazon prime video app, on the blue screen there are some lines which i dont know whether its problem with panel or application. need to chk with amazon customer service for the reason. if any user can help or enlighten me on this issue that would be super.6- conclusion - frankly speaking i bought this tv only bcz i got it almost under <number> bought for <number>- including extended warranty for <number> years bcz even if some mishap happens when the kids playing it wont pinch me . so from my perspective i felt its okay with some minor issues like sound. i just need to get clarity on that prime video issue. if that is sorted i will be happy.happy diwali to team.,i have bought this tv at <number> and at this price tag its a great purchase.picture quality is good not at per with sony or lg <number> k tv but better than its rivals like mi redmi vu etc. va pannel works fine and gives good amount of blacks.prosandroid tvsoundcolourconsremote,loved the picture quality,average picture quality but ok for this price,worth for the cost. nice quality and clarity,good,good product,good support team as unit reached within <number> hours installation done within time of installer called. demo properly given. and company call also received in <number> days for confirmation of material delivery and installation done proper way .",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Pu9zNUbtL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

i must have removed and re-inserted them almost <number> times before they were properly detected. no error messages showed up, and i didnt know if i had recieved a faulty product, or if i was doing something wrong.3. never having owned a printer, and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work, i ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray, leading to a jam at the first print itself. thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces. canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets - clearer access to the online guide mightve helped here.except for the these minor concerns in setup, im enjoying using this printer surprisingly, since printers alongside projectors are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry. ive used all the features so far - print colored, double sided, scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality, wifi or the cartridges. information on the number of color and black-and-white sheets from the initial set of cartridges to be added when i run out,good scanner printer,installation procedure is very simple and priter quality is high. i had a xerox copier, but istallation of scanner option could not complete.,if you are purchasing it for your home use, dont look any further. it has got all the functions youll find in a <number>-<number> k worth printers. all in one includes print, scan, copy and fax as well, colour, adf, duplex printing, wifi. you download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself. only two issue that i faced, firstly the print qualitywhich ill speak to the service center and secondly is the total quantity of color prints. i have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is <number>. i guess ill have to purchase a larger cartridge.,very good printer. sometimes back to back printing cases paper blockage. but overall very happy,gud printer but printing cost is expensive. in this price range features are very nice.,i got this printer ion <number> nov2022, after <number> days of usage ..im unable to print as it is showing color black ink is low ..i have print less than <number> pages ...and in description they told that <number> pages yield which is totally wrong.,cannon e4570.this was launched as a successor for e4270 i searched everywhere but couldnt find a credible source to explain the differences between the two. i researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me - wifi enabled so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop, clear color print decent for childs homework, photo quality not required and cheap to run. e4270 seem to fit all the criteria, so i ordered this. even the canon authorised showroom didnt have e4570 in stock, so ordered the e4570 off amazon.summary - fullfills top two criteria. though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional print.delivery was <number> days earlier than the delivery date shown on amazon, so that was great. it was just the printer box, with no outer packing. the box was sealed with cello tape, and not sealed, so i suspect it had been opened at some point. thankfully, all the components were there, and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact, so i was ok with the delivery.setup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi. i never had to use the usb cable. setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website link for both given in manual, which guides step by step on how to setup. i did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devices.color prints are a bit faded on plain paper <number> gsm. this might be a function of the paper and not the printer. the blackwhite prints are crisp and sharp. the print speed is decent.the only negative is the amount of ink consumption. while the box says <number> color prints and <number> bw, both my cartridges are showing at <number> after <number> color print and around <number> bw. specially for color prints, the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just <number>-<number> prints. i suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that <number>-<number> full color pages. refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option, but it is messy and requires practice. this is fine for me as i need color prints very rarely.a special mention for the adf and duplex printing. both the features are extremely useful. duplex printing is especially unique in this price range, and comes in very handy while printing larger documents.overall, i am happy with my purchase after couple of weeks of usage. i will update the review if i run into any issues.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31AZelC8URL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

you need to buy mi ir cable and set it up. or else directly connect the set up box via av or hdmi port, to use it conventionally. out of <number> gb memory, you only get around <number> gb free to use check the image attachedthere are hundreds of review on this tv here as well as on youtube, but none explains the tvs potential completely and what its actual flaws are. heres a quick fact for the users complaining about the less cost to benefits ratio, guys if you buy a android tv box alone which has processing capacity similar to this tv, then it would alone cost you more than <number> k rupees here you get this tv with that android setup with various other feature under <number> k. so just check once, what options you have before complaining.eventually i bought this tv, since i was already using <number> a <number> version for months and wanted smaller version for bedroom. now after using this tv for over <number> weeks, i am stating my detailed user experience. its a detailed huge review, but do read it, if you want to invest this much amount. if you want to get quick overview of the device, then read below else scroll down for detailed review firstly its budget friendly only smart tv under <number> k in the current market. has most number of output port <number> av, <number> hdmi, <number> usb . has android <number> out of the box along with inbuilt bluetooth has dual interface - mi patchwall android tv i mostly prefer android tv interface remote has bluetooth voice search with sleek profile. has better processor compared to predecessor along with <number> gb ram <number> gb storage <number> gb actual speaker output is low. need ir cable for using set top box with android interface. amazon prime netflix is not preloaded, but can be side loaded. native display is only hd, though <number> p even <number> k videos from youtube works well check images attached. can install play tons of high quality games like rr3, etc check images attached. finally smartphone mirroring works fine most of the time.full detailed review ----built quality ------------------ has combination of plastic and aluminium for the main body. its not great, but above average. table top stands looks bit flimsy, but are workable. the screws which are provided in the box, does not fits the tv perfectly, so i bought new from local store. it has averagely slim profile, not the slimmest in the market. speaker placement is inconvenient. since they are placed at the bottom, so when you keep it on table top, the sound tends to dampen and bulge. has good ventilation for electronics and it hardly heats up. overall built quality is above average.display quality --------------------- it has very thin bezels, which looks great. video resolution is <number> x768 p, but <number> p videos works fine on it. <number> k videos on youtube runs smoothly as well. viewing angle are good compared to price. check the images attached contrast is above average, brightness is good and colours are quite vivid. display quality is also above average, not very great.remote control ----------------------- its very sleek and compact. has only <number> buttons and is easy to operate. fortunately it has volume buttons, which is handy. i have couple of android tv boxes without volume button on remote, so i know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume p placement of voice search button is improper. its just below power button, and i end up pressing power button a lot. finally its bluetooth, so no need to point it towards tv for operation.other features --------------------- it has dual interface, i.e. patchwall and android tv. has tons of content. many games can be installed till you have memory left, including multiplayer games. google voice search is very useful, if you dont want to use keyboard. processing speed is fast and i havent detected any lags yet. lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed, not due to hardware bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectly.cons ------ speaker output though rated <number> w, is not upto the mark. my <number> w jbl speakers has better and louder sound. placement of speaker is inconvenient, as in table top position, speakers face the table and sound dampens. internal memory is very less. no netflix and amazon prime pre loaded, though you can side load them. miracast not supported. even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes. native resolution is just <number> p hd, though the <number> p videos works on usb <number> k on youtube. screen is slightly reflective, its similar to almost all the other led tvs. mixed experiences of after sales service.customer care -------------------- firstly the installation is a joke. my installation was scheduled <number> days after my product delivery and the fun part is, theres only <number> days replacement window for this product p company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their representative, so theres no point of return window time frame. mi has mixed reviews for repairs and services. though i have not encountered any problem with any mi tv yet, i have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpful.verdict -----------considering all the facts, if you are fine with above average display quality, want a smart tv and if you have tight budget, then this the tv you should certainly go for. trust me, you wont get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months. if you have higher budget, then certainly explore brands like sony, samsung, etc.this is not a perfect smart tv, but for the given price and <number> years of warranty, its no brainer to choose this, its certainly worth the investment.,this television is definitely a perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of <number>.performance -----------------------the processor in this smart tv is powerful enough to play <number> k <number> bit hevc videos right out of the box. vlc or mx player can be installed for enhanced media support.picture quality --------------------------many people complain about the overbright screen. but it can be compensated by adjusting the display settings.these are my preferred settings.backlight <number> to <number> during night even the lowest value of <number> is bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyes.during day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions. a maximum of <number> would be enough.setting backlight to minimum improves black levels, reduces power consumption, increases led life and reduces eye strain especially during night.brightness <number> brightness setting controls black level.increasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrast.brightness at <number>, pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturationat <number> black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies.48 is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of details.contrast <number> to <number> contrast setting controls white level.contrast can be set anywhere between <number> and <number>. increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in a picture, like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed. as the screen itself is very bright, increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright. also colors gets washed out while increasing contrast.saturation <number> to <number> color saturation can be set anywhere between <number> to <number>. at <number> colors look more natural. at <number> colors looks a bit punchy. but still its a personal preference.at the above settings, the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of oled tvs on youtube at <number> p . the following youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the tv.lg <number> k oled beauty of black demolg oled eclipse <number> demolg hd demo art nouveaufull hd and <number> k videos looks sharp in this tv. downloaded a sample <number> k hevc video named life untouched and also a <number> k hevc sample of the movie elysium. both of them played smoothly on the tv with very good details.screen quality --------------------------i think this is a va panel , the quality of which sits right in between tn and ips panels. the screen is glossy and hence reflective. this might be a problem if the tv is placed in a room with windows facing it.like all other lcd panels, this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but thats only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds. while watching movies or other content its not at all a problem. screen non uniformity is a common issue even with high end tvs of big brands like lg samsung etc.luckily theres no backlight bleeding in the unit i received.viewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but thats a common va panel characteristic. ips panels with good viewing angles cant be expected at this price point.all lcd panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses. ips panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels. va panels excels in black depth despite its average viewing angles and this tv has got very impressive black levels.sound quality --------------------------bass is a bit weak i think bass is improved following some updates. so giving <number> stars from <number>. its very loud even at low volume. midrange and treble are very good. even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearly.editin a previous review i have mentioned these eq settings sounds good. but it isnt.100 hz <number> hz <number> hz <number> hz <number> hz <number> a high value of <number> for <number> hz actually make the sound muddy and muffled.the following settings sounds much better and heres the reason.100 hz <number> - bassfrequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like kick drum,toms, snare etc.300 hz <number> - low midrangeenhances bass and depth of male vocals. increasing <number> hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds1000 hz <number> - midrangeimparts a metallic tone. increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant.3500 hz <number> - upper midrangevocals especially female sounds best at this frequency. a value of <number> enhances vocal quality. increasing too much makes vocals harsh.10000 hz <number> -trebleadds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments. enhances tinkling sounds of metallic instruments.human ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies here its <number> and <number> hz. setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue. even increasing <number> hz is disturbing.great sound performance especially bass is not even expected from a television in this budget. but considering its midrange frequency, clear treble and loudness, it deserves <number> stars.remote control -----------------------------minimalism is great. but minimalism with less functionality is not so great. addition ofmute,tv settings and video input selection buttons would ve made the remote more functional.app support update-----------------------when the tv was released there was no support for netflix and amazon prime. but now with pie update it supports both netflix and amazon prime. now the tv deserves <number> stars for app support.pros and cons--------------------------- pros1. powerful processor for <number> k media playback.2. app installation via usb3. built in chromecast4. bluetooth remote5. voice commandcons updatepreviously the main issues with the tv were the lack of autoplay function and standby option.but in the latest update both these issues are solved.now when the tv is turned on it will automatically go to the previous input sourceto enable it, go to settngs inputs enable stay on the previous source option.screen off feature is also added in the new update. long pressing power button will show screen off option.the only disadvantage left on the tv was lack of miracast. but on a latest update build pi.4316 miracast is included and now its perfect.to sum up--------------------overall considering the picture quality, powerful hardware and the price, the tv definitely deserve <number> stars devoid of its average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other tvs in market with such features at this price point. also xiaomi now has got very strong service support across india.new brands like iffalcon, blaupunkt ,thomson etc might provide better options at a competitive price. but when it comes to service centres, its a dead end.i am very much satisfied with the purchase.,its good product,good,if you like a best tv on your budget ill recommend you this stunning picture quality and dts surround is osm but there was a few lagging problem and miracast is not good ,build quality good.sound and bass excellent.,product is very good. sound quality is crisp. worth buying. i brought it <number> years back. still working fine,good quality",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41nsy8kxWUL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

<number> k. i am not a person who believes to burn money for phones. my requirement was a phone that has good network reception, good wifi reception, a balanced software, good battery life, good screen that dont strain eyes, a good hardware, <number> mm headphone jack, and a charger. i dont need <number> g network because <number> g drains battery a lot and <number> g spends too much data. i dont watch movie or yt on mobile network and i wonder how many does watch fhd, <number> k, <number> k videos over mobile network. for downloading documents, social networks, banking apps <number> g is more than enough.in my budget i found all phones have <number> gb ram. realme narzo <number> was <number>- during gif and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was redmi note <number>. but i found that if i can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer i can get a redmi note <number> with <number> gb ram at <number>- . <number> gb ram is always preferred over <number> gb ram because nobody knows whether with future updates the os would demand more ram or not, also the softwares may require more ram as time passes away. so this was the only option i knew then available.redmi note <number> has amoled display, i am not bothered with <number> hz, <number> hz,120 hz. i keep the refresh rate at <number> hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. all my desktop screen has <number> hz refresh rate and i am happy with them so why do i need a <number> hz screen i think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. the display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. you can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but i think standard is fine for me. also you can calibrate display colours in settings but i think you dont need that. display size is <number> inch it could have been better if it were <number> inch. i prefer big display phone. redmi note <number> has that big display. a plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and i am happy with that. the screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. the screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.this phone duel speakers. one is more powerful at bottom and another on top. but i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or yt. bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. what more do you expect from such tiny speakers!the phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience i can say my phone and wifi modem stays at different floor, still i get good signal, and never disconnected. voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. however because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.the phone has <number> mah battery and comes with <number> w charger which is a bonus at this price point. the battery gives long backup. with good mobile network you can use it for <number> days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, fb, wa etc. but i charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below <number>.the phone has sd680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. the experience is butter smooth. however the apps get automatically cleared from ram which i like because i dont have to clear ram manually. however after android <number> update the ram hold app for longer time but eventually cleared. sd <number> doesnt heat up and it is very energy efficient. because of that battery drains very little and <number> w charger charges phone within <number> mins for my usage. the cable is usb a to c and feels good.this phone has ir blaster so in your home office you can control ac or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.this phone has ddr4 x ram and ufs <number> storage. the ram is <number> gb and can be expanded additional <number> gb as virtual ram by occupying storage. but i have disabled that option from settings because it increases ssd life. this has <number> sim sd card slot. which is a great. both sim have volte and carrier aggregation.the phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. some people may complain about plastic but remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. and i have no problem with plastic. i dont think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. i am happy with plastic back. the phone also gives a tpu cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. this is inherent chemistry of tpu, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. how ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.the fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. the touch screen is excellent too.however i dont like some of the preinstalled apps. some can be uninstalled a few cant especially mi pay and getapps from mi store. i dont like them. however i like the pre installed security app. there is no ad in notification and all can be easily disabled. camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. does not show pictures like <number> mp camera. i have added some pictures clicked by redmi note <number> back camera. miui is fluid and has many user friendliness like oneui. miui is now free of bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.so i give redmi <number> a score of <number>. this is an excellent phone the i got at <number>- during great indian festival. i recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. this phone is not for gamers or people who watch <number> k, k videos or shoot such things. this is not or those who are crazy for <number> g. otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. good battery life. bqest for day-day use. <number> w charger also good.2. best display but shouldve <number> hz instead of <number>.

<number>.7. <number> g chipset sd <number>, which is fine... <number> g always available.8. some minor issue with wifi reception. dont know may be they will fix it through ota. this phone is for people who clicks photos here there, casual gamer binge watchers of web showsmovies... not intended for heavy gamingnot for pubg, cod lovers.,the first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and its all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, its battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also <number> w, is also a good deal at this price. the third impressive factor is its dual speaker....i have an another phone of <number> k and the sound quality is almost same as it. media playback experience is also enhanced by its amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. the camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. other performance like gaming is also good at this price point. fingerprint button is also very responsive. all other things and features are good to the price point.only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old redmi y2 which i exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....so plz i request you to all .... dont buy this for camera....just dont. the images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......i dont recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.if you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.pros- design, in-hand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakercons- camera,quite a smooth daily driver phone. the overall experience has been satisfactory, cameras good, durability also seems to be good, ive dropped it quite a few times the gorilla glass <number> seems to be holding up. <number> hz feels great. charging speed is good too, nothing mind-blowing though. battery life is decent. lasts quite a bit, but since i keep it in the <number> hz mode all the time, its a little less for me. but i dont have any problem with battery life for now.,it does what the description says.camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. even a3 model clicks better pics.finger print sensor is same as that of the lock button. you need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.volume is good for both call and streaming.fast charging but charger gets heated soon.battery back up is good, unless you dont do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.dual app and dual space option is missing.light weight and good video resolution.overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography gaming.,i bought this for my dad and its working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. after that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.when i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every <number> sec, but after manual installation its working

but afraid of future miui updates.,dont purchase it as camera phone ,dependable its been a year.,budget mobile,good for basic use,phone is nice , but software is not","i was looking for a phone below <number> k. i am not a person who believes to burn money for phones. my requirement was a phone that has good network reception, good wifi reception, a balanced software, good battery life, good screen that dont strain eyes, a good hardware, <number> mm headphone jack, and a charger. i dont need <number> g network because <number> g drains battery a lot and <number> g spends too much data. i dont watch movie or yt on mobile network and i wonder how many does watch fhd, <number> k, <number> k videos over mobile network. for downloading documents, social networks, banking apps <number> g is more than enough.in my budget i found all phones have <number> gb ram. realme narzo <number> was <number>- during gif and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was redmi note <number>. but i found that if i can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer i can get a redmi note <number> with <number> gb ram at <number>- . <number> gb ram is always preferred over <number> gb ram because nobody knows whether with future updates the os would demand more ram or not, also the softwares may require more ram as time passes away. so this was the only option i knew then available.redmi note <number> has amoled display, i am not bothered with <number> hz, <number> hz,120 hz. i keep the refresh rate at <number> hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. all my desktop screen has <number> hz refresh rate and i am happy with them so why do i need a <number> hz screen i think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. the display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. you can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but i think standard is fine for me. also you can calibrate display colours in settings but i think you dont need that. display size is <number> inch it could have been better if it were <number> inch. i prefer big display phone. redmi note <number> has that big display. a plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and i am happy with that. the screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. the screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.this phone duel speakers. one is more powerful at bottom and another on top. but i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or yt. bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. what more do you expect from such tiny speakers!the phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience i can say my phone and wifi modem stays at different floor, still i get good signal, and never disconnected. voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. however because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.the phone has <number> mah battery and comes with <number> w charger which is a bonus at this price point. the battery gives long backup. with good mobile network you can use it for <number> days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, fb, wa etc. but i charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below <number>.the phone has sd680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. the experience is butter smooth. however the apps get automatically cleared from ram which i like because i dont have to clear ram manually. however after android <number> update the ram hold app for longer time but eventually cleared. sd <number> doesnt heat up and it is very energy efficient. because of that battery drains very little and <number> w charger charges phone within <number> mins for my usage. the cable is usb a to c and feels good.this phone has ir blaster so in your home office you can control ac or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.this phone has ddr4 x ram and ufs <number> storage. the ram is <number> gb and can be expanded additional <number> gb as virtual ram by occupying storage. but i have disabled that option from settings because it increases ssd life. this has <number> sim sd card slot. which is a great. both sim have volte and carrier aggregation.the phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. some people may complain about plastic but remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. and i have no problem with plastic. i dont think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. i am happy with plastic back. the phone also gives a tpu cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. this is inherent chemistry of tpu, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. how ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.the fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. the touch screen is excellent too.however i dont like some of the preinstalled apps. some can be uninstalled a few cant especially mi pay and getapps from mi store. i dont like them. however i like the pre installed security app. there is no ad in notification and all can be easily disabled. camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. does not show pictures like <number> mp camera. i have added some pictures clicked by redmi note <number> back camera. miui is fluid and has many user friendliness like oneui. miui is now free of bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.so i give redmi <number> a score of <number>. this is an excellent phone the i got at <number>- during great indian festival. i recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. this phone is not for gamers or people who watch <number> k, k videos or shoot such things. this is not or those who are crazy for <number> g. otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. good battery life. bqest for day-day use. <number> w charger also good.2. best display but shouldve <number> hz instead of <number>.

<number>.7. <number> g chipset sd <number>, which is fine... <number> g always available.8. some minor issue with wifi reception. dont know may be they will fix it through ota. this phone is for people who clicks photos here there, casual gamer binge watchers of web showsmovies... not intended for heavy gamingnot for pubg, cod lovers.,the first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and its all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, its battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also <number> w, is also a good deal at this price. the third impressive factor is its dual speaker....i have an another phone of <number> k and the sound quality is almost same as it. media playback experience is also enhanced by its amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. the camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. other performance like gaming is also good at this price point. fingerprint button is also very responsive. all other things and features are good to the price point.only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old

m33 <number> g a mixed bag of affordability","i would not consider buying an i-phone simply because my friend owns two of them or blindly go for a new android model suggested by my son or nephew both of whom are more tech savvy than me because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. i am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes but i think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. applying a technocratic approach, i would not choose a costlier option unless i get additional features which suit my requirements.my foremost requirement which is entirely non-negotiable is that my handset must have provision for two sim cards, since i do not want to carry two separate handsets for my cug and personal numbers. my other requirements are not difficult to fulfil a phonebook with at least <number> contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous whatsapp and my favourite word games which do not need much memory or processing capacity. i would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity sufficient for <number> hours or preferably <number> hours at my normal level of usage. besides, i would like to use a new handset for at least two years.apart from exigencies, i do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as i prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.i am equally clear about what i do not need. i do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. nor do i want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as i would prefer to use a camera. at the risk of sounding flippant, i would say that i do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf primarily because i do not own a car and i do not play golf!having used smartphones of samsung and motorola makes over the past few years, i vastly prefer the former. my last phone, which gave me over <number> months of good service, was a samsung m30. since that model is obsolete now, i focused on its upgraded cousins m32, m33 and m52. the last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two sim cards along with an sd card. after studying the relative specifications of m32 and m33, i concluded that the latter offers better value for money. generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher ram versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. with these considerations, i narrowed down my choice to m33 with <number> gb ram and <number> gb storage just twenty years ago, i was using a desktop with <number> gb memory!as a confirmation for my choice, i compared the phone i had selected with oneplus nord ce <number> <number> gb ram, <number> gb storage which my son had recommended. the specification of the samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was tft instead of amoled. i also watched some youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. the clinching factor was that the samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the oneplus product.as for body colour, my first choice was emerald brown, but i settled for the mystique green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. i was thinking this would be irrelevant since i use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.despite a strong family resemblance with my old one m30, the new phone m33 offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. it is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. thanks to the <number> mp front camera and <number> mp selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about <number> metres from the stage. this phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. youtube reviewers complain that the m33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an immersive listening experience and its screen is plain old tft instead of amoled. i am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the m33 meets my requirements.i was glad to find that samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. however, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. the recommended charger for m33 is <number> watts, but the chargers i had at home are rated at <number> or <number> watts.to cut a long story short, i ordered a <number>-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. after using the new handset for a couple of weeks, i find that my phone is at <number>-<number> charge at the end of the day, and it takes <number>-<number> minutes for complete charging one of the useful features of m33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging. it turns out that i could have managed with the old <number>-watt charger, except that it would have taken <number>-<number> minutes for full charging.i

auto data switchingconnector type <number> mm jack","the perfect phone for my requirements,galaxy m33 <number> g a mixed bag of affordability","i would not consider buying an i-phone simply because my friend owns two of them or blindly go for a new android model suggested by my son or nephew both of whom are more tech savvy than me because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. i am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes but i think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. applying a technocratic approach, i would not choose a costlier option unless i get additional features which suit my requirements.my foremost requirement which is entirely non-negotiable is that my handset must have provision for two sim cards, since i do not want to carry two separate handsets for my cug and personal numbers. my other requirements are not difficult to fulfil a phonebook with at least <number> contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous whatsapp and my favourite word games which do not need much memory or processing capacity. i would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity sufficient for <number> hours or preferably <number> hours at my normal level of usage. besides, i would like to use a new handset for at least two years.apart from exigencies, i do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as i prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.i am equally clear about what i do not need. i do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. nor do i want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as i would prefer to use a camera. at the risk of sounding flippant, i would say that i do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf primarily because i do not own a car and i do not play golf!having used smartphones of samsung and motorola makes over the past few years, i vastly prefer the former. my last phone, which gave me over <number> months of good service, was a samsung m30. since that model is obsolete now, i focused on its upgraded cousins m32, m33 and m52. the last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two sim cards along with an sd card. after studying the relative specifications of m32 and m33, i concluded that the latter offers better value for money. generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher ram versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. with these considerations, i narrowed down my choice to m33 with <number> gb ram and <number> gb storage just twenty years ago, i was using a desktop with <number> gb memory!as a confirmation for my choice, i compared the phone i had selected with oneplus nord ce <number> <number> gb ram, <number> gb storage which my son had recommended. the specification of the samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was tft instead of amoled. i also watched some youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. the clinching factor was that the samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the oneplus product.as for body colour, my first choice was emerald brown, but i settled for the mystique green since the former was not available in my selected

far.1. received a defective product. battery was getting drained out in few hours, wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble, including google maps. location was not getting captured2. tried to return it on the <number> th day of purchase after running into issues with every app i open. tried on <number> th night as well, but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile - amazon app was in this phone. used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile3. amazon said return window is closed on <number> th night and now i need to call samsung customer care directly for replacement.4. called samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely - couldnt identify the issue.5. informed i will have to visit the samsung service center to figure out the issue6. first visit to center, they did a software update <number> week old phone now - not sure what update would be pending and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week. they also whipped out the entire apps in the phone.7. faced issues the very same evening, lived with it for one more day and went back next morning.8. second visit, they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced.9. i requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesnt allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery, which was defective11. they told me i will have to contact samsung customer case number again if i want a product replacement as they dont have the authority for that.10. called customer care number again, and they inform me i have to contact amazon for product replacement as amazon was the seller.so back to step <number>. will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end , if i manage to reach there.update <number>. all customer care said they cant replace the phone. so surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement. they gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced. again, whipped out of the apps which i had downloaded and logged in again.12. i checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and i figured the problem still persist battery was draining out by the minute. i showed it to them. they told me its a new battery and will take some time to stabilize. they also asked me to buy a super fast charger, while i bought from them to not take chances. they asked me to check for <number> days and confirm. used for <number> days. same situation. no improvement.13. went back to them again. they checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now.14. technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a <number> days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this. i have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true.15. by this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product, but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests.15. they kept the phone for <number> days and returned saying everything is fixed.16. phone started functioning normally finally but i was sick and tired of the experience.17. i called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund. they refused with all their might and said phone is working now. during the process i also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for <number> days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for <number> days. i officially registered a complaint. but still no luck of returning the phone.update on nov <number> th.18. i was traveling and outside the country. on nov <number> st while using the phone and with <number> charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some tv from <number> s. tried switching of the mobile and restarting multiple times. no luck. still grid lines. my flight bookings, hotel bookings and everything one can think of, was in the mobile and my <number> month old phone is not responding to anything possible. friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till i completed the trip.19. reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center. nov <number> th. am writing this update sitting at the customer care center. they mentioned patch issue. software update dint happen . at this point, i know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation. no <number> month old phones screen will stop responding because of software update missing. they are opening the phone again to operate it, after again refusing my request for money refund.,its really good smartphone in its range packed with features. and brand like samsung never fails to amuse with what they deliver at a given price point. i still give it a <number> stars as battery could be better. it also looses a

android tablet that makes sense in the non-sense tab market of india.,an impressive tablet for android at last,all good but miner bugs just dont upgrade it to <number>.6.. new update details given,good tablet","first i would like to comment on the tab market of india. the most peculiar thing i have seen in india is, when a particular product is aimed towards students or education suddenly corporations go out of their way to milk money and under deliver as much as possible. it is exactly opposite to how students are given access to technology in the usa. you watch the prices of chromebooks, tablets, back to school offers in the us and compare them to india and it feels extremely unbalanced. after the pandemic there was a huge surge in the tab market and tier <number> brands started delivering garbage for <number> rupees. snapdragon <number>, old mediatek, <number> gb ram, abysmal non ips screen for <number> k just to mint money and take advantage of pandemic scenario and the circumstances of students. this tablet brings the revolution.i am no student, but bought this for day to day use and i am an user of the normal big bezel <number> th gen ipad, so my review will be comparative in nature. also i bought this at <number> rupees so my judgements will be in accordance to the price i paid.1. if you are planning to buy an ipad, just buy it considering <number> gb is enough for you and you use it for normie scenarios. you do day to day stuff you will be satisfied with your ipad with its everlasting updates.this tablet if compared spec vs spec give a good challenge to the ipad for <number> k rupees. even for <number> k it is fine.2. build is fine although i put a tempered glass on the <number> st day itself. back is plastic but sides are metal and the back gets quite smudgy.3. the ips screen is really good, there is no backlight bleeding, no dead pixels as you can see in the picture with the dark background. i am used to oled screens on phones so at first blacks may disappoint but oled is impossible at this price. the screen is better than my <number> th gen ipads display. it is brighter, has more punchy colours, blacks are darker. on top of that <number> hz panel, hdr certification, dolby vision support makes it great for content consumption. it would be a great device for xbox cloud gaming with the xbox controller attached to it. display is the part of the device with which you interact the most and display is the highest point of this tablet.4. snapdragon <number> is fine in a market where older mediateks and lower midrange snapdragons are dumped into the market. hence i say if you dont want this just buy an ipad but dont buy any other android tablet at <number>-<number> k price point. all are trash. <number> was fine with all those games which rule the market today. it has less pixels to push than in a phone and the bigger surface area helps in better heat dissipation so gaming is effortless.5. i cant comment on how the battery will serve me in the long run but for now i dont see any drain or backup issues with content consumption or gaming. it has a <number> watt charger in the box although it does support <number> watt charging. the bigger battery takes some time to charge with the inbox charger but my ipad takes even longer with its trash charger and it has a bigger battery and apple devices are extremely picky with chargers.6. the camera is okayish, just like most tablet cameras. the ipad has even worse cameras. for document scanning it should be fine but other than that it is not much useful. it is still better than what samsung and lenovo gives in <number> k range tablets.7. the second highest point of this tablet is its quad speakers. they are loud, have depth, are not sibilant and have brilliant stereo separation and soundstage. they are louder and punchier than those normal non ultrabook thiccc laptops which cost <number>-<number> k. they will hit you as a massive surprise. i did not at all expect such good speakers. they seriously outmatch those cheapo <number> rs boat, goat, mivi generic speakers in terms of distortion at max volumes, separation and low end. of course those cheap speakers would be louder and more shrill but it is about quality vs quantity.coming to the cons-<number>. was it courage or something else that xiaomi couldnt find a place for a <number> mm jack. not even a dongle in the box. they should seriously stop copying apples wrong habits and instead copy their good habits like long device support via updates. although i mitigated the issue by using portable dongle dacs like shanling ua1, ibasso dc03.....etc which i generally use with even my phones and my pc coz they are way better than on board audio of most devices except some devices like some lg phones with quad dac. i am an audio enthusiast so i spend money on such products and you need not. although it works with my old mi a2 dongle just fine.2. for <number> rupees i dont expect the pen and people who are expecting a pen with <number> k tablet should really open their eyes and look the disaster also know as indian tablet market and its offerings but for <number> k they could just offer a bundle where you pay <number> k-<number> k rupees more and get the pen as an add on.3. the accessory market might not be that vibrant. already there are no unofficial cases available from good brands. there is one from nillkin here on amazon and the seller has the audacity to price it at <number> rupees lol. the official xiaomi folio case is magnetic slap on at the back and i dont trust those type of cases.one more issue that i would like to point out is that xiaomi lately has a tendency to creep up prices by <number>-<number> rupees within a month or two by doing the good old gst bro. so if it ever reaches <number>-<number> k for the <number> gb version just close your eyes and buy an ipad with card discounts.so, in a nut shell for <number> k it is was no brainer, but even for <number> k it is a really good deal considering what its competitors are.hope this was helpful.,i have been using the mi pad <number> for over a month now, and am only glad that i didnt spend more on an ipad. once the retail-therapy phase of the device wears off, what remains is the user experience. while it is true for both devices, i find that im more at ease with the mi pad <number> for the sheer look and feel of the content i watch in it. i also spend a lot of time reading books and illustrated designs pdfs and i often found myself amazed almost chuffed over how good the content looked. that display gets the accolades for a reason.the mi pad <number> largely meets my expectations and when people see this tablet, the immediate comparison they make is how much it resembles the ipad a gross generalisation. so, heres my take on apples ipad <number> th gen vs. xiaomi pad <number> if you have an apple device already, and are especially looking to expand on the productivity element from the tablet, you need to stick to the ipad. not just because it is going to regulate the standard, but you will definitely miss out on the features that eco-system offers.so, buy the ipad if youare not concerned about the price-tagare looking at designing with the apple pencil and are familiar with, or going to use procreateare making an investment with this purchase and will not be back in the market for a new tablet anytime soon.intend to use the tablet for presentations and want to take no chances with the devicehave a clear purpose for the sidecar feature - if you dont use it despite buying the ipad, you are missing out!engage in a lot of official video-conferences and are prone to moving about and may accidentally go out of frame. the ipad has a feature that addresses this to an extent.are not expecting substantially higher results than the mi pad <number> from the in-built camera in general.have a proclivity towards the apple design, their decisions and are generally happy with the software choices apple makes for you.dont really care about features beyond a rigid list of activities you are certain the ipad is able to do and that this list is unlikely to change in the near future.looking for a reliable product that will receive software support for a long period of time.are expecting the device to be used by responsible adults who are careful with the tabletare unaffected by hefty repair costs should the glass crack or the rear panel be dentedhave a need to use touch idon the other hand, buy the mi pad <number> if youare looking at gaming on a plethora of titles that are on the google playstore and perhaps not found elsewheredont care much about the stock ios cookie-cutter experience and think customization is the only way youll truly be happy with the tablet you use.want the best quality of video and photo capture from a tablet - meaning better video calls and video capture. this doesnt mean the camera will replace the phone you already have, but the pad <number> is a tool that goes the extra-mile of taking good quality images, scanning documents and allows edits on its large screen.value video-quality from the mi pad camera than the ai that drives the face-tracking function ipad offers.want the most of the audio experience, higher audio quality, clarity and richness.are expecting rich colour depth, hdr quality video

product eureka forbes took time for installation,water wastage is <number>.,great product this ro purifier,awesome product","product and service review-buying price <number> during prime day sale with <number> discount from hdfc debit card.product review!rating <number> this is a new model launched during prime day from eureka forbes aquaguard line of products named aquasure delight.the product is pleasant to look and comes with a capacity of <number> l on paper but holds only <number> liters of water, equipped with reverse osmosis, ultraviolet radiation lamp and manual adjustment for total dissolved solidscan be manually adjusted only by service engineer!, the <number> liter tank fills at about <number> mins but the water wastage is very high for every <number> litre water purified there is a drainage of <number>-<number> litre from the drain pipe please collect the water and reuse it for washing utensils or bathing, shaving or watering plants. the drained water is same as tank water just with higher tds. the water taste varies according to the level of tds you choose very low tds will give a good taste to water but at a loss of the mineral content of water which i will not recommend. the default tds after purification is set somewhere between <number>-<number> drinking water should have tds below <number> manufacturer reviewrating <number> the manufacturer of this product is eureka forbes i am giving a rate of <number> because the product that is now installed at my home is a replaced product because the first product that i received was a defective one. the drain pipe would not stop draining water even when the tank was full, i asked the technician to check it and he said the valve is defective so i received a defective product out of the box! i ordered for a replacement on amazon which they processed and i got another one in which the led lights were displaced i dont know it happened during transport or it is some manufacturing defect i would have been disappointed for the second time but i observed it and reported to the technician who replaced the led lights to their original position so that the led indicators were now visible outside. the replaced products valve is functional and now operating without any hassle!service review05 dont expect to have a very comfortable installation experience its going to be a heartache. the reasons are1. the people eureka forbes has employed as technicians are thieves, i am saying this because aquasure delight comes with integrated diverter valve, this is a stainless steel structure that is fitted to water outlet coming from the wall so that it can act as converter to be joined to the aquaguard inlet! as i hadnt opened the package when it arrived! because some or many of the companies void the warranty of you open the box containing the product, mostly electrical items that need installation like tvs washing machines taking the precaution i didnt open the box so i was unaware that diverter is included in the package! the technician after fitting the diverter charged rs <number> saying that he fitted that from his side and diverter is not included in the package. i came to know this when i opened the package of the replaced product and found the diverter included along and confronted him but he defended saying some purifiers have diverter in them and some dont. i still have to confirm this with eureka forbes!<number> the pre filter doesnt come included in the package so the technicians sell it to you at higher prices, my technician sold it to me at rs <number> which is available at amazon at rs <number> but then if had ordered it from amazon i have to install it by myself. i dont have a drill etc so i had to pay him rs <number> so loss of rs <number> on the technician. my opinion on this is that eureka forbes should sell water purifiera with pre filter even though it raises the cost of the product by rs <number> to rs <number> platform review!<number> the platform in which i bought is of course amazon i am giving it a rating of <number> because i received a defective product the first time and amazon refused to replace it because installation request was not raised by amazon amazon never raises an installation request unlike flipkart which raises an installation request from its side, which actually makes your life easy as in case if you receive a defective product which you notice after installation flipkart directly consults with the technician and may even resend him to verify the authenticity of the problem for installation you have to call the eureka forbes toll free number and raise an installation request, so amazon representative was demanding an installation report, a video or photo proof of the problem, now how could i make that thief of a technician to write an installation report and about taking a photo or video i got the water purifier uninstalled as soon as i found it defective to put it up for replacement but i didnt know replacement request has these many hassles as it was my first time replacing an electronic product!summary1 product is good for the mentioned price!<number> aquasure comes with integrated diverter valve a stainless steel device that is attached to your water outlet and the aquaguard, dont let your technician charge you for it.3 the technician will overcharge you for pre filter be ready for that.4 technicians are cunning and mostly thieves so be sharp around them.5 make sure product is not defective if it is amazon is going to give you a hard time replacing it.6 amazon will not raise an installation request you have to raise it by yourself by calling eureka forbes customer care!overall verdict- <number>,if your family in <number> members you have choice eureka forbes delight rouvtds this product is very effective and efficient. agua guard provides installation with in <number> hours of delivery. before the installation had tds level is <number>, and after the installation had tds level is <number>. nice product by aquaguard, water taste is also sweet.,this is very good water purifier but i see service guy for installation seems in hurry. he just installed and went off. he did not show how much is tds, how to adjust it. dont buy this product on amazon. buy it from local stores if possible.,i purchased this product on a heavy festival discount. there was problem initially after installation due to defective water holding knob. i reported this issue and immediately replacement was arranged. although i had to wait for about two weeks. the serviceman came and installed another piece. since then it is working excellently. in all, the best part was that the services were good and responsive.,amazon part of the business was smooth.delivery done within timelines. payments, exchange, cashback all done hassle free.eureka forbes another story.for installation i had to call them daily for <number> days.finally on escalation and on hold with eureka forbes customer service for close to <number> minutes, installation was done.eureka forbes now calls me every other day to force this review.my main reason for writing this review.,i got the purifier installed and before that i was having bislery water reason why i have so many bottles which thankful came handy. the deliver and installation was smooth. after installation the agent mentioned to let the filter fill up completely and then throw away all the <number> st batch of filtered water since its the <number> st time filteration process so it will basically clense it overall.so i decided to let it full up and once it was full, i turned off the switch so no more whater comes in. i used the empty <number> l bislery bottles to fill up the <number> st batch of filtered water which as shown in the image which is around <number> l as mentioned by the company.after i emptied the filter to its last drop, i turned on the filter with another set of empty bottles at the waste pipe side. it took quite a while to fill up the tank fully but as it did it filled up almost <number> l worth of bottles as seen in the image. this is roughly <number> or more than twice the amount of filtered water.now the company claims <number> water saved in comparison to other rouv filters and i have no knowledge of how much water wastage they do. but i think its a bit much regardless.fir every <number> l of purified water, it wastes <number> l.my tal water tds is <number> filtered water tds is <number> and the waste water tds is <number> maybe its because of the tds levels due to which it wastes as much water ky does and its possible that the amount might vary for different tds levels at source.but i recommend to have the waste water collected and used for something else if possible rather than just letting it drain down. <number> l almost everyday wasted is <number> l per month and this is considering you only filter <number> l of water per day.ill redo this once more to see if theres any difference in values. this is juts to keep the potential buyers informed.,i like speed to fill water n less wastage. i like tds adjuster and easy to install . i dont like internal plastic body though i believe its steel.. need confirmation. overall good product we are satisfied having it installed from <number>-<number> weeks,deserve a <number> star on product. however, ran into a problem when it comes to installation. the technicians of the servicing centre at my local area gave me a huge problem by delaying the installation. at last one technician came forward.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Anei7Di0L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

m33 <number> g a mixed bag of affordability","i would not consider buying an i-phone simply because my friend owns two of them or blindly go for a new android model suggested by my son or nephew both of whom are more tech savvy than me because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. i am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes but i think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. applying a technocratic approach, i would not choose a costlier option unless i get additional features which suit my requirements.my foremost requirement which is entirely non-negotiable is that my handset must have provision for two sim cards, since i do not want to carry two separate handsets for my cug and personal numbers. my other requirements are not difficult to fulfil a phonebook with at least <number> contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous whatsapp and my favourite word games which do not need much memory or processing capacity. i would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity sufficient for <number> hours or preferably <number> hours at my normal level of usage. besides, i would like to use a new handset for at least two years.apart from exigencies, i do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as i prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.i am equally clear about what i do not need. i do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. nor do i want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as i would prefer to use a camera. at the risk of sounding flippant, i would say that i do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf primarily because i do not own a car and i do not play golf!having used smartphones of samsung and motorola makes over the past few years, i vastly prefer the former. my last phone, which gave me over <number> months of good service, was a samsung m30. since that model is obsolete now, i focused on its upgraded cousins m32, m33 and m52. the last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two sim cards along with an sd card. after studying the relative specifications of m32 and m33, i concluded that the latter offers better value for money. generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher ram versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. with these considerations, i narrowed down my choice to m33 with <number> gb ram and <number> gb storage just twenty years ago, i was using a desktop with <number> gb memory!as a confirmation for my choice, i compared the phone i had selected with oneplus nord ce <number> <number> gb ram, <number> gb storage which my son had recommended. the specification of the samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was tft instead of amoled. i also watched some youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. the clinching factor was that the samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the oneplus product.as for body colour, my first choice was emerald brown, but i settled for the mystique green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. i was thinking this would be irrelevant since i use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.despite a strong family resemblance with my old one m30, the new phone m33 offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. it is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. thanks to the <number> mp front camera and <number> mp selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about <number> metres from the stage. this phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. youtube reviewers complain that the m33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an immersive listening experience and its screen is plain old tft instead of amoled. i am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the m33 meets my requirements.i was glad to find that samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. however, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. the recommended charger for m33 is <number> watts, but the chargers i had at home are rated at <number> or <number> watts.to cut a long story short, i ordered a <number>-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. after using the new handset for a couple of weeks, i find that my phone is at <number>-<number> charge at the end of the day, and it takes <number>-<number> minutes for complete charging one of the useful features of m33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging. it turns out that i could have managed with the old <number>-watt charger, except that it would have taken <number>-<number> minutes for full charging.i conclude by emphasizing that samsung galaxy m33 <number> g is the perfect phone but for my requirements. a word of advice if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.,with <number> g connectivity, a <number> hz display and solid performance, the galaxy m33 <number> g is

i knew i wouldnt be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save <number> k. i knew even if i wanted a voice assistant, i could plug in fire tvmi tv box and get those features later on. delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the tv in the room i asked for, and opened the box to inspect the tv for any physical damages. samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.soundper other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, i found it satisfactory. i have it wall mounted in a <number> x12 ft room, and the tvs speakers sound better compared to bose soundlink speakers that i connected it to via bluetooth.picturethe panels great, but nothing worth raving about. gray uniformity isnt greati.e. gray tones wont be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, therell be darker zones towards the edgescorners based on backlight placement. blacks arent perfectly black - and theyre brighter than youd expect from a va panel, but this isnt noticeable at all when the room is lit. no backlight bleed. colors are as good as id like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to <number>. <number> p content is watchable from <number> ft, <number> p is goodid say better than i expected, and <number> k is well, <number> k.connectivityi have a <number> mbs broadband connection and all content streams in <number> k when available, without stutters. the tv has bluetooth <number>, and works with tws and neckband earphones finei use oppo enco w51 and boat rockerz <number> - theres no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.apps featureshas all the standard slew of streaming apps i needed - netflix, hotstar, prime, apple tv youtube. all of them stream <number> k content, except for hotstar - which only streamed <number> k a few times. <number> p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. no dolby vision support - which i made my peace with considering the fact that <number> of budget tvs in the market cant produce the contrast youd expect out of dv content anyways, so why care. you get hdr, and hdr content is definitely better looking than non-hdr ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. i planned to use the tv without cable, but the tv does come with some channels like republic tv, bloomberg, <number> xm, etc., these stream in <number> p, so a great bonus to have.remotevery basic rf remote, unlike bluetooth ones on most new tvs. the remotes looks pretty sleek and stylish, but thats about it. biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, youll need to use the d-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. you can control the tv using samsungs smartthings app, but guess what - you cant even use your phones keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but its not there yet.attached pictures are all of <number> k content. resolution might get scaled down after i submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the tvs designlooks, panel colors and contrast, etc.id say im really happy - and given the chance, wouldnt change my decision. its a samsung tv, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than i expect, i can overlook all other cons. id highly recommend the tv if you have the same expectations from your next tv.,placed order on <number> th dec22 received defective product, updated to amazon service they replaced with new product today271222.will post long term review.pros picture quality, design thin n bezel lesscons sound bit okay,upsacling of sd channelsover all satisfied.,have been using it since month now.-picture quality is amazing. <number>-as always installation service from samsung was seemless. <number>-smart features are good this model dont have voice recognition. i dont require it so its fine. <number>-audio quality is not good. its clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall. it also lacks base.purchase a sound bar separately if buying this model.,but the picture quality is ok-ok.,best tv product in given price range,value for money. samsung is always good,value for money product",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Tz1YnJkoL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg

installation experience,overall taking all aspects tv is good within the price point,tv installation services,one among the good tvs in the market.,picture","i am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.usage continuous, ott only, no cabledish operator.average daily usage <number>-<number> hours.the tv is a great value-for-money product.installation the installation was simple and amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hassle-free.picture the picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a sony, lg and samsung with these kind of specs. movies and especially hi-res tv series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hi-res , wouldnt look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of sony, samsung lg etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone elses better tv.sound sound output is decent. you wouldnt need additional support to enhance the volume as such.remote sleek, sensitive and user-friendly. its exactly like amazons remote.os same as any smart android tv. works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.standalone and as your first smart tv, you wouldnt find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hi-res from the beginning. it is a great value for money product without a doubt.however, if you are considering this as an alternative or second tv after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,picture quality is good for this price, didnt faced any lag on ui and browsing other apps. only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. overall worth for money u spend. but the installation process is just awful, amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took <number> hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. no demo given on tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,screen looks amazing but problem is with processor i believe. if <number> k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickersnot so often but problem exists, even remote control is not good as it take at least <number> sec to react for the user action.reason why i believe processor is bad because i do <number> k gaming using ps5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,if you buy tv in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. when you want to buy a tv from amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. the problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. its like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you cant eat. so i ordered my tv on monday, it got delivered on friday and it will be installed on monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. if we had the technician details, we could reach out s get it installed but that also will be shared <number> hours before.regarding product, its good quality and very good for a average user. heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, i guess.,this tv gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is <number> k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1 the installation guy didnt arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didnt came for installation purpose. so strictly be aware of this point.2 the tv i got in offer with <number> k discount on icici card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3 even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece i didnt got the replacement for the product and its totally unfair deal by amazon and the seller too.final verdict is the tv quality and feature are good but the service from seller and amazon that is got was very poor inspite i was prime member. the seller dawntech electronics private limited gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases amazon will not help you. thankyou,team,also to be added tv installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. no need to other sub-vendor to getting installation and demo. also dependency on third-party involvement should be less.bad experience with tv installation stuff.pls look into this .,picture quality good. sound quality not upto my <number> xpectations. not able to find the real dolby stereo effect. remote not upto the mark.4 for picture quality, <number> for both sound and remote quality,good quality picture but it hangs on home

this watchpros amoled display is very bright and nice look and design is premium bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch. calculator features is useful multi functional crown button is easy and useful .. easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only <number> mb but sufficient to store around <number> songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine strap quality is good and soft tws connecting features is also nicecons sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day fingerprints are clearly visible on screen glass .. i have attached the pic for ithealth tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... <number>-<number> accurate only.. ai voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for rs.3420- including bank offer . for this price range overall its a good premium watch ..its my experience with this watch for just a one dayrest how it work for long run that depends..,recieved a damaged device at first... slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....the replacement was good...amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just <number> hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..prossmooth enough uifairly accurate readings on all the sensorsheartrate bp and spo2 call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..you can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... and it is seamless...display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below <number> k watch...so you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch strap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... not too comfy..i ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...ui looks much better in person than reviews.. ui is smooth and looks good... not as good as realme watch <number> pro..but still good for the price..overall its a good watch for the price of around <number> k <number> kanymore and it is not worth the pricerealme watch <number> pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below <number> k then get realme watch <number> pro..or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under <number> kconscall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is onesteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterbattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... maybe around <number> daysbut otherwise battery stays for over <number> days.blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around <number> ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..,i write this review after <number> week of using this watch, bp, bpm, spo2 running and sleep tracking functions are working well, watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers. the only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again, as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it, overall its a good watch.,everything is absolutely greta in this smartwatch.but these things could have been better. watch faces- you should have the option to add upto <number>-<number> watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and <number> pre-installed ones. app ui could have been better. dnd mode absent. no option to toggle bluetooth always on,before review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucher.i loved the touch screen experience amoled screen of the watch, it gives a feel of premium watch. the band of the watch is average doesnt look premium i separately ordered a metal band. i am expecting mobile app improvement from fireboltt as i dont find it good enough if i compare it with boats app for its watches as i own a boat smartwatch. rest visionary is a good buy worth the money the only thing which physically is not appealing is the average quality of the band.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41r1d8a2WGL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

top notch display, gorgeous display, heavyly and seriously powerful device thanks to <number> gen <number>. tremendous battery life in heavy usage. super cool device. silky buttery experience with blazing fast performance. good sound quality. the form factor is really good. i mean the screen is flat, so it feels like a widenot actually wide but feels like phone also it is tall, thats why it really feels good at hand. i have an ipad but all the work now can be done by phone so i am happy.didnt like it - as i had op5 t i loved oxygen os, but now it feels like realme ui. camera is worst for this price. main sensor is good other two are useless. company should provide a telephoto lens in this price range. i had op5 t and previously op3 t,both camera were good. op10 t camera is exactly same as nord <number> t.conclusion - if you looking for speed, performance, battery life, longevity, best of display, premium feel then go for it.if you are looking for op experience like an alert slider, or a good camera then please dont choose this. either u can wait for the next op or go for other devices. if you dont bother about ui experiencei.e. oxygen then go for iqoo9 tits far better in specgo to gsmarena compare op10 r and op10 t. exactly same specification except processor and charging speedthis much fast charge is not required by excluding important spec .,i am oneplus user since their <number> st phone. i have used oneplus <number> , oneplus nord , nord ce, nord <number> t and now <number> t. i have been using <number> t as my primary phone since last <number> month. everytime oneplus never fails to impress with their new phone but this time you would feel something is missing may be because oneplus has already raised their bar so much that user always expect more from them . when i saw <number> t first time , somewhere in my subconscious mind i had taken my decision to buy this beast. but before i reviewed so may phones, from one nord <number> to iphone <number>.my ratings design and build <number> camera quality <number> battery backup and charging time <number> performance <number> undoubtedly design and build is unmatched. so sturdy and beautiful. camera quality might be discussion point. they should have given more in camera because phone comes in high range and premium level but current camera is not so bad. noone can beat its battery charging time and backup time. within <number> min <number> to <number> , highly impressive. it will survive around <number> day for average user. performance is good , installed and ran multiple apps at a time, never faced any hung issue or app carsh issue.as i said , even if wow factor is missing this time, i would say good phone with nice overall performance , design and features. if you get it in sale around <number> k its a good deal . go for it , nothing to regret. ,purchased it some days ago !!switched from my asus so i had really high expectations and well, it did perform somewhat close to it but also many downgrades as well, im just gonna list as pros and cons !pros - i mean snapdragon <number> gen <number>, you can expect amazing performance, why not top tier since its the best processor android could offer well cause i feel the processor on this one is under clocked to reduce heating but its holding up pretty good in terms of gaming and other benchmark tests and stuff.- build quality is actually good, especially the back, the back does feel amazing and while holding it does feel like a premium phone, expect for the frame ofc, its made of polycarbonate but we can get a hang to it later.- software, im not gonna sit around and cry about their merging with oppo, i feel its fast and a good ui, of course some old features not available now since ive used a oneplus <number> in the past for some weeks but we can get a hang to this new oxygen os, just hope its not completely turned to color os.- charging is just insanity on this one, switching from a phone which used to take around <number> hours to get fully charged to this one, almost finishing full charge under <number> minutes and ive witnessed it several times, its just impressive but some issues and ill talk about it in cons.- networking and connecting is fast and good! havent faced any major issues in my networking experiences! calling is a good experience, connecting with networks and bluetooth is extremely fast, good overall.cons - about the processor, like i said it is under clocked and the benchmark scores proved it a bit, although i dont care about benchmark scores and just want to keep my belief in real life usage so it is doing good.- polycarbonate frame and no alert slider like really at least we deserved a metal frame at this price segment which is what upset me a bit, not really a big fan of alert slider so i didnt mind that part.- the camera setup is so so so average and stupid, aside from the main lens, the wide and macro just did not make sense at all and are completely worthless in this segment, this is literally the same setup from nord <number> t but just a better software optimisation, front camera is alright too, nothing that great- charging indeed is one of the key factors in this phone but it takes a toll on the battery backup, usually in my usage i have to charge it <number> times for it to be used the whole day, it drains a bit more than i expected it to, also theres no option available to disable <number> w charging to let it charge in usual speed to test the battery, only except for the night optimisation mode, which is kind of good in my opinion.phone is a good segment in this price range and if you do believe in the particular brand image and its products then go for it. although iqoo <number> t does provide a better camera setup with a bit more aggressive processor performance, but this device does the job too.,so , basically i am reviewing it after usage of <number> month and <number> days. i am giving it <number> star because of alert slider missing. lets me clear it by points.1. battery is awesome. it will get full charge in <number> minutes <number> seconds. it lasts more than <number> hours to me.2. camera quality is nice. specially night mode is awesome. some improvements should be done for selfie camera but it clicks nice picture.3. no lagging , no hang. it runs smoothly and very fast.4. only thing that disappoints is alert slider that is missing in this phone.5. video quality is awesome while you record and it is stable.6. while watching any ott , streaming quality is awesome. you can fully enjoy it <number>. speaker of phone is perfect, even at lowest volume you can clearly hear the voice on call.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413c3ZnFLxL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg

please do not avail the so called free installation service from amazon. it is just a scam. instead call the acer support. they will do the job much better.,after using it for <number> months, here are its pros and conspros <number>. great picture quality. its awesome.2. blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. sound with <number> db is very good4. looks great with thin besel5. remote comes with favorite ott buttons.6. content upscaling is very good.cons1. remote could have been better. cant use dth remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. remote operation is bit complex.3. motion technology not great. there is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson ott, but it decreases when you switch to dth.overall, its a nice buy at this price point. i think i am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. i am satisfied with the product.,product has good picture quality. good product at that price with <number> w sound. applications running smoothly. <number> months older no issues yet. its running smoothly.,you get decent features for the price you pay. screen resolution might be. set back as you may find pixalation. overall its good,i am amazed with the picture quality of this <number> p hd ready tv. it is truly an amazing panel. i found it suitable for a viewing distance of between <number> to <number> feet. any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. the speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. however, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the tv is wall mounted or kept on a stand.the remote is good, voice search works well for me. tv start up takes a long time in my opinion, but i have not compared it against any other <number> inch tv and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 ghz wifi works very well even across walls. only negative aspect i faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphonesearphones. firstly, the connection sometimes doesnt happen automatically after a restart - which means i have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of <number> feet in front of the tv, the signal breaks even if you move your head by <number>-<number> inches.however, i am still super happy with this tv. i got it for <number> k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,at this price range11499-it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is goodsometimes lagging.no major issues found on this tv.just go for it.,vellu for money. good product,very nice productsave money",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/515t5K7hdqL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg
